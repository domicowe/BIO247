Serum starved cells were incubated with fresh serum-free media for 1 hour at 37degreesC ( in order to return the phosphorylation levels of p44/42 MAPK to the basal state ) and then treated with insulin ( 2.5 mug/ml ) or vehicle for 5 min .
To examine whether the p44/42 MAPK pathway mediates insulin signaling in the H441 cells , PD98059 , an inhibitor of the p44/42 MAPK pathway , was used [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Since it is possible that the insulin mediated stimulation of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation had ended within a 15 min exposure to insulin , we performed additional experiments in order to evaluate the possibility of a shorter time course of insulin action .
Thus , phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK may be involved in the up-regulation of SP-A gene expression , results consistent with our observation that inhibition of basal levels of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation may decrease SP-A gene expression .

Instead , TSH stimulates the accumulation of p27 [ XREF_BIBR ] , which to our knowledge provides a unique such an example in a mitogenic stimulation .
This obviously contrasts with the positive roles ( stabilization and nuclear anchoring ) of these " inhibitors " on D-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes , and the frequent observation that they can support the pRb-kinase activity of CDK4 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Paradoxically , this cAMP dependent triggering of cell cycle progression involves an accumulation of the p27 kip1 CDK inhibitor [ XREF_BIBR ] but not of the D-type cyclins [ XREF_BIBR ] , as observed in cell systems where cAMP blocks G1 phase progression [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

Conversely , increased expression of p15 in response to TGFbeta [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] , ERK dependent p16 up-regulation [ XREF_BIBR ] , or p18 up-regulation by progestin [ XREF_BIBR ] destabilize D-type cyclin-CDK complexes and mobilize p27 .

For instance , in dog thyrocytes the withdrawal of the cAMP stimulation rapidly arrests the entry of cells in S-phase and pRb phosphorylation but does not reverse the formation of nuclear cyclin D3-CDK4-p27 complexes [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Accordingly , mutations of CDK4 within its ATP binding domain ( G15A and G18A ) , which preclude Cdc37 and CDK4 complex formation , also greatly reduce binding of CDK4 to cyclin D1 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
At variance with previous conclusions [ XREF_BIBR ] , p27 does not inhibit the activity of D-type cyclin-CDK4 complexes by preventing the activating phosphorylation of CDK4 .

Parry and collaborators reported that overexpression of p21 can promote the association of D-type cyclins with CDKs by counteracting their binding to INK4 proteins [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In addition to the observation discussed above that Thr172 phosphorylation of CDK4 is not prevented by inhibitory concentrations of p27 , other arguments call for a reconsideration of CDK4 activating kinase ( s ) .
Whereas knockdown of Fbxo7 reduces p27 expression and association of CDK6 with D-type cyclins , Fbxo7 fails to assemble cyclin-CDK6 complexes in vitro , and ectopic expression of Fbxo7 only moderately enhances CDK6 association with D-type cyclins and pRb-kinase activity .

Taking into account that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis , while proteasome activation promotes cell survival , it is conceivable that a biphasic behavior of curcumin on proteasome can lead to either apoptosis or survival , depending on the dose used .
Similarly , NF-kappaB transcription factor , which is involved in pro survival and apoptotic pathways , is inhibited by curcumin .
Recently , curcumin has been shown to repress histone acetyltransferase dependent chromatin transcription by inhibiting its p300 and CREB binding protein .
It was previously reported that curcumin inhibited proteasome activity .
Similarly , the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in the curcumin induced apoptosis remains elusive . ++++ Curcumin induced apoptosis has been reported to be p53 dependent . ++++ Moreover the role of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in curcumin induced apoptosis is controversial , since curcumin can exert both pro- and anti-oxidant effects . ++++ A dose dependent decrease in intracellular ATP levels after treatment of osteoblast cells with curcumin was observed and pre-treatment of cells with antimycin or 2-deoxyglucose to cause ATP depletion significantly converted 12.5-25muM curcumin induced apoptosis to necrosis . ++++ In fact , sensitivity of many tumor cells to curcumin correlates with generation of ROS and many well-known antioxidants prevent curcumin induced apoptosis . ++++ Finally , curcumin can induce apoptosis via ER stress in HL-60 cells . ++++ Accordingly , curcumin is known to induce apoptosis in numerous animal and human cell lines , like leukemia , melanoma , breast , lung , prostate , colon , renal , hepatocellular and ovarian carcinomas [ reviewed in and ] . ++++ However , we have observed that apoptotic phenomena also occur in p53 deficient HL-60 cells upon curcumin treatment , and other authors also showed that the curcumin induced apoptosis of lung and colon cancer cells appears to be p53 independent .
In this review we discuss the biological mechanisms and possible clinical effects of curcumin treatment on cancer therapy , and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer 's Disease , with particular attention to the cell death processes induced by curcumin . ++++ Furthermore , curcumin has an anti-angiogenic activity and it can induce cell death in a wide variety of in vitro cancer and noncancer cell cultures . ++++ Thus , it is possible that discrepancy of data on protection against cell death by curcumin can be accounted for , at least in part , by this methodological bias , taking into account that the symptoms of cell death induced by curcumin can be different and depend on the cell context . ++++ In in vitro studies , curcumin inhibits proliferation and/or induces cell death in many different cell types . ++++ Indeed , we should remember that in in vitro experiments curcumin can also induce cell death in normal cells , such as rat thymocytes and human T cells . ++++ On the whole , all the aforementioned data indicate that curcumin can induce cell death via different molecular pathways and with different executing mechanisms , i.e. classical apoptosis , but also mitotic catastrophe , necrosis and maybe autophagy ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Clearly we are far away from completely elucidating the mechanisms of curcumin induced cell death . ++++ This can be a misleading concept , since it has been reported that cell death can occur independently from DNA degradation , and very recently we showed that curcumin can induce cell death of Jurkat cells despite a simultaneous inhibitory effect on DFF40 and CAD endonuclease activity .
In another in vivo study , parkinsonian neurotoxin ( MPTP )-induced GSH depletion and lipid peroxidation in rat striatum and mid-brain was blocked by curcumin treatment .
Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl cysteine or alpha-tocopherol , that are ROS scavengers , attenuated the intracellular ROS levels increase and converted the apoptosis to necrosis induced by 12.5-25muM curcumin .
Taking into account that proteasome inhibition induces apoptosis , while proteasome activation promotes cell survival , it is conceivable that a biphasic behavior of curcumin on proteasome can lead to either apoptosis or survival , depending on the dose used .
Recently , curcumin has been shown to repress histone acetyltransferase dependent chromatin transcription by inhibiting its p300 and CREB binding protein .
Finally , the effects of curcumin can be described as xenohormetic , since it activates a sort of stress response in mammalian cells .
In their paper , Ali and Rattan show that curcumin treatment ( up to 1muM for 24h ) increased chymotrypsin like activity of the proteasome by 46 % compared with that in untreated keratinocytes .
Recently , curcumin has been shown to repress histone acetyltransferase dependent chromatin transcription by inhibiting its p300 and CREB binding protein .

PPARgamma ligands inhibit the proliferation of non small cell lung carcinoma ( NSCLC ) cells in vitro . ++++ We have reported that PPARgamma agonists inhibit NSCLC proliferation by inhibiting the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) signaling pathway through PPARgamma dependent and -independent mechanisms [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Interestingly , silencing of TSC2 reduced the growth inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone by approximately 50 % , whereas a control siRNA had no effect ( XREF_FIG ) .
Taken together , our results demonstrate that rosiglitazone inhibits NSCLC cell growth in part through activation of TSC2 with the consequent suppression of mTOR signaling .

When compared to a control siRNA in a thymidine incorporation assay , the TSC2 siRNA reduced the growth inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone by fifty percent . ++++ Silencing TSC2 restored the mTOR related signal and partially blocked the effect of rosiglitazone on cell growth inhibition .
In cell proliferation assays , we showed that the TSC2 siRNA partially restored NSCLC cell growth in the presence of rosiglitazone , although knockdown of TSC2 alone had no effect on NSCLC cell proliferation .
This suggests that TSC2 does not contribute to NSCLC cell proliferation at baseline , but its phosphorylation partially mediates the growth inhibitory effect of rosiglitazone .

Silencing of TSC2 by siRNA induced phosphorylation of p70S6K at baseline and inhibited p70S6K downregulation in the presence of rosiglitazone demonstrating a direct link between TSC2 induction and inhibition of mTOR signaling ( XREF_FIG ) .
In line with this , we showed that rosiglitazone increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in NSCLC cells . ++++ Rosiglitazone increases the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK , but blockade of p38 MAPK and its downstream signals had no effect on rosiglitazone induced activation of TSC2 . ++++ Similarly , we found that rosiglitazone induced a transient increase in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in a time dependent manner with maximal induction at 2 hours ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Rosiglitazone also increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK , but inhibitors of p38 MAPK and its downstream signal MK2 had no effect on rosiglitazone induced activation of TSC2 .
Here , we report that rosiglitazone increased the phosphorylation of TSC2 highlighting the relevance of this tumor suppressor in mediating the effects of rosiglitazone . ++++ However , in the current study , blockade of p38 MAPK and its downstream signal MK2 had no effect on rosiglitazone induced TSC2 phosphorylation suggesting that the p38 MAPK cascade plays no role in mediating the effect of rosiglitazone on TSC2 . ++++ To test if phosphorylation of TSC2 by rosiglitazone was mediated through activation of PPARgamma , cells were pretreated with a selective PPARgamma antagonist , GW9662 , or PPARgamma siRNA before exposing them to rosiglitazone . ++++ As shown in Figures XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG , SB239063 , a selective p38 inhibitor , and KKKALNRQLGVAA , a potent and selective inhibitor of MK2 , had no effect on rosiglitazone induced TSC2 phosphorylation ( serine 1254 ) .
Note that the rosiglitazone induced phosphorylation of TSC2 occurred at serine 1254 , but not at threonine 1462 sites , which are sites different from those phosphorylated by Akt and AMPK [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

We found that cells knocked down for both PRR5L and the mTORC2 component SIN1 were similar to cells knocked down only for PRR5L , with regard to induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ PRAS40 deficiency prevents induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide . ++++ HeLa cells in which PRAS40 was knocked down were protected against induction of apoptosis by TNFalpha and cycloheximide .
The above suggests that mTORC2 dissociated PRR5L may promote apoptosis when mTOR is hyperactive . ++++ PRR5L promotes apoptosis . ++++ In particular , in response to hyperactive mTOR signaling , PRR5L may dissociate from mTORC2 to promote apoptosis .
In addition , mTORC2 phosphorylates Ser473 in the hydrophobic motif of Akt and thereby activates Akt toward substrates such as the Forkhead transcription factor FOXO and the apoptosis regulator BAD XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR . ++++ This suggests that mTORC2 may activate Akt toward PRAS40 .

Together these results suggest that both the PY motif and the putative ERK phosphorylation site in the beta-ENaC subunit of the channel are required for full ERK1/2 mediated acute inhibition of ENaC activity and sodium absorption . ++++ Mechanism of ERK dependent Inhibition of Sodium Absorption . ++++ ERK1/2 dependent Inhibition of Sodium Transport Is Not due to a Reduction in Channel Delivery . ++++ The results of the present study demonstrate that there are critical sites in the intracellular C terminus of beta-ENaC that are required for ERK1/2 dependent inhibition of sodium current and that the inhibitory response is due to sequential effects on channel activity and surface expression . ++++ Three types of mutations were introduced into the beta-ENaC subunit in order to evaluate the importance of specific sites in ERK dependent inhibition of sodium transport . ++++ EGF receptor mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades could lead to changes in membrane potential and/or intracellular ion composition sufficient to alter the electrochemical potential difference for sodium across the apical membrane , but it is difficult to reconcile such a mechanism with the observation that beta ENaC mutations abrogate the ERK dependent inhibition of sodium absorption .
Whereas , mutation of the putative ERK phosphorylation sites in either beta-ENaC ( T613A ) or gamma-ENaC ( T623A ) reduced the progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current by only 20-25 % . ++++ XREF_BIBR reported that truncation of all three ENaC subunits prevented progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current in an oocyte expression system . ++++ It is unlikely that phosphorylation of ENaC per se is responsible for the ERK dependent reduction in ENaC activity since mutation of the adjacent PY motif blocked progesterone and EGF induced inhibition of sodium current .
Additional experiments were done to confirm that the EGF induced inhibition of sodium absorption required ERK1/2 phosphorylation . ++++ It is unlikely that phosphorylation of ENaC per se is responsible for the ERK dependent reduction in ENaC activity since mutation of the adjacent PY motif blocked progesterone and EGF induced inhibition of sodium current . ++++ The results of the BFA ( XREF_FIG and XREF_TABLE ) and the exogenous trypsin ( XREF_FIG ) experiments suggest that alterations in channel cleavage can not explain the EGF induced inhibition of sodium absorption .
Acute Downregulation of ENaC by EGF Involves the PY Motif and Putative ERK Phosphorylation Site . ++++ Introduction of the beta S518K mutation ( gating mutant with P o ~ 1.0 ) did not prevent the early inhibition by EGF , indicating that the mechanism by which EGF inhibits ENaC is independent of the normal gating process that is altered by the S518K modification .
Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) causes acute inhibition of Na absorption in collecting duct principal cells via an extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK )-dependent mechanism . ++++ Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) causes acute inhibition of Na absorption in collecting duct principal cells via an extracellular signal regulated kinase ( ERK )-dependent mechanism .
ERK1/2 dependent Inhibition of Sodium Transport Is Not due to a Reduction in Channel Delivery . ++++ Three types of mutations were introduced into the beta-ENaC subunit in order to evaluate the importance of specific sites in ERK dependent inhibition of sodium transport .
Together these results suggest that both the PY motif and the putative ERK phosphorylation site in the beta-ENaC subunit of the channel are required for full ERK1/2 mediated acute inhibition of ENaC activity and sodium absorption .
Furthermore , the small inhibitory effect of EGF on sodium transport in MDCK cells expressing the R564st , P616L , and T613A mutations was completely abolished by an ERK kinase inhibitor ( XREF_FIG ) , consistent with a role for the corresponding PY motif and putative ERK phosphorylation site in the C terminus of the gamma-ENaC subunit .
A similar result was obtained from studies of oocytes in which point mutations in the PY motif of either beta- or gamma-ENaC ( Y618A or Y628A , respectively ) were found to completely prevent progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current .
Brefeldin A ( BFA ) , which blocks transport of protein from the ER to the Golgi network , was used to inhibit the trafficking of new ENaC channels to the plasma membrane .
The transient increase in I sc is not due to activation of silent ENaC channels since addition of amiloride ( 100 muM , apical ) to block ENaC before trypsin did not alter the transient current , but did prevent the small steady-state increase in I sc ( XREF_FIG ) .
A similar result was obtained from studies of oocytes in which point mutations in the PY motif of either beta- or gamma-ENaC ( Y618A or Y628A , respectively ) were found to completely prevent progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current .
It is the rate limiting step in the process of sodium reabsorption and is important for maintaining electrolyte and water balance and , thereby , blood pressure .

Deletion of the beta-ENaC Subunit C Terminus Blocks EGF induced Inhibition of Amiloride sensitive Sodium Absorption . ++++ The effect of EGF on ENaC mediated sodium absorption in MDCK cell lines that express mutant beta ENaC was determined . ++++ Disruption of the PY motif by mutation of beta-ENaC P616L ( a human Liddle 's disease causing mutation ) was as effective as the R564st beta-ENaC truncation mutation for preventing the EGF induced inhibition of sodium absorption in MDCK cell monolayers ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ All three mutants exhibited significant attenuation of the EGF induced inhibition of sodium current .
To explore the importance of the PY motif and putative ERK phosphorylation site in the acute downregulation of ENaC by EGF induced ERK1/2 activation , a stable mammalian expression system was developed . ++++ EGF induced activation of the ERK signaling cascade has been implicated in a variety of cellular functions , including cell migration , cell cycle progression , and differentiation .
It stimulates transport through the Na + -K + -ATPase , but reduces the expression of ENaC mRNA in alveolar type II cells . ++++ EGF modulates Na + transport in epithelial cells in a several ways .
Second , a significant portion of the progesterone induced decrease in sodium current may be ERK independent .
The small increase in current was also observed in MDCK monolayers treated with EGF before exposure to trypsin ( XREF_FIG ) .
Our results are consistent with an ERK mediated decrease in ENaC open probability and enhanced retrieval of sodium channels from the apical membrane .
Epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) is a potent activator of the extracellular signal regulated kinases ( ERK ) in wide range of mammalian cells .

Insulin and vasopressin also increase Na + transport in the collecting duct .
Deletion of the beta-ENaC Subunit C Terminus Blocks EGF induced Inhibition of Amiloride sensitive Sodium Absorption .
Furthermore , we found that exogenous trypsin increased amiloride sensitive I sc by only a small amount ( ~ 15 % ) in MDCK cell monolayers expressing wild-type ENaC , a result incompatible with the existence of a large pool of silent , inactive sodium channels in the apical membrane of these cells .
EGF receptor mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades could lead to changes in membrane potential and/or intracellular ion composition sufficient to alter the electrochemical potential difference for sodium across the apical membrane , but it is difficult to reconcile such a mechanism with the observation that beta ENaC mutations abrogate the ERK dependent inhibition of sodium absorption .
For example , heterologous expression of ENaC and the EGF receptor in CHO cells reconstituted a response in which EGF induced inhibition of ENaC activity did not require ERK activation .
Deletion of the beta-ENaC Subunit C Terminus Blocks EGF induced Inhibition of Amiloride sensitive Sodium Absorption .
Insulin and vasopressin also increase Na + transport in the collecting duct .
EGF receptor mediated activation of intracellular signaling cascades could lead to changes in membrane potential and/or intracellular ion composition sufficient to alter the electrochemical potential difference for sodium across the apical membrane , but it is difficult to reconcile such a mechanism with the observation that beta ENaC mutations abrogate the ERK dependent inhibition of sodium absorption .
Insulin and vasopressin also increase Na + transport in the collecting duct .
In summary , our results are consistent with an ERK mediated decrease in channel P o and enhanced removal of ENaC from the apical membrane .

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of the beta-ENaC PY motif and putative ERK phosphorylation site in EGF induced inhibition of sodium absorption in mammalian renal epithelial cells .
This protein can deubiquitinate ENaC , resulting in an increase in sodium absorption .

Whereas , mutation of the putative ERK phosphorylation sites in either beta-ENaC ( T613A ) or gamma-ENaC ( T623A ) reduced the progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current by only 20-25 % .
While progesterone has been shown to increase ERK phosphorylation at 6 and 12 h in oocytes , the progesterone induced decrease in sodium current is nearly maximal at 30 min , and Frisov and coworkers did not show that progesterone induced inhibition of sodium current was prevented by an ERK kinase inhibitor .
Previous studies have demonstrated EGF induced inhibition of ENaC mediated sodium absorption in murine renal collecting duct cells .
High expression levels of the cell-cell adhesion molecules , E- and N-cadherin , reduce the nuclear localization and transcription potential of beta-catenin , by recruiting it to sites of cell-cell contact ( Sadot et al. 1998 ; Orsulic et al. 1999 ) .

Integrin mediated adhesion has been shown to recruit a variety of structural and signaling molecules into specialized sites and to cause the membrane localization of the GTPase , Rac ( Burridge et al. 1992 ; del Pozo et al. 2000 ) . ++++ Integrin Mediated Adhesion Regulates ERK Nuclear Translocation and Phosphorylation of Elk-1 . ++++ Thus , integrin mediated adhesion permits ERK to efficiently localize in the nucleus and phosphorylate a key downstream nuclear substrate . ++++ Furthermore , active ERK molecules can be detected at sites of integrin mediated adhesion ( Fincham et al. 2000 ) . ++++ Integrin mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix permits efficient growth factor mediated activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases ( ERKs ) .
In vitro kinase assays demonstrated that ERK activation by 22W Raf was not inhibited by treatment with CCD ( XREF_FIG B ) . ++++ However , in our system it is unlikely that dephosphorylation of ERK is upregulated in suspended cells , as ERK activation mediated by active versions of either Raf or MEK was unaltered in suspension versus adherent conditions .
These data show that integrin mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton regulates localization of activated ERK , and in turn the ability of ERK to efficiently phosphorylate nuclear substrates . ++++ These data show that integrin mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton regulates localization of activated ERK , and in turn the ability of ERK to efficiently phosphorylate nuclear substrates .
These data show that integrin mediated organization of the actin cytoskeleton regulates localization of activated ERK , and in turn the ability of ERK to efficiently phosphorylate nuclear substrates . ++++ For example , engagement of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 and alphaLbeta2 has been shown to initially bind and subsequently promote the nuclear localization of the c-Jun coactivator , JAB1 , leading to enhanced activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcriptional activity ( Bianchi et al. 2000 ) .
ERK is sequestered in the cytoplasm through its interaction with binding partners , such as its upstream activator MEK , and efficient ERK mediated activation of gene transcription is enhanced through the binding of the scaffolding protein , MEK partner 1 ( MP-1 ) ( Schaeffer et al. 1998 ) .
For example , engagement of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 and alphaLbeta2 has been shown to initially bind and subsequently promote the nuclear localization of the c-Jun coactivator , JAB1 , leading to enhanced activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcriptional activity ( Bianchi et al. 2000 ) .
However , in our system it is unlikely that dephosphorylation of ERK is upregulated in suspended cells , as ERK activation mediated by active versions of either Raf or MEK was unaltered in suspension versus adherent conditions .
We next examined whether the inability of ERK to accumulate in the nucleus of nonadherent tet-MEK *-3T3 cells , induced to express active MEK , corresponded to inefficient phosphorylation of a nuclear target .
For example , engagement of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 and alphaLbeta2 has been shown to initially bind and subsequently promote the nuclear localization of the c-Jun coactivator , JAB1 , leading to enhanced activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcriptional activity ( Bianchi et al. 2000 ) .

As relatively low levels of ERK signaling are sufficient to induce cyclin D1 ( for a review see Roovers and Assoian 2000 ) , our results may provide an explanation for these discrepant observations .
An intriguing notion is that integrins , via the formation of an actin based platform , enhance the ability of ERK monomers to homodimerize .
In contrast , Le Gall et al. 1998 found that forced ERK activation is not sufficient to induce cyclin D1 and downstream events , such as hyperphosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and S phase entry , in suspended CCL 39 fibroblasts .
Similarly , GAL4-Elk-1 activity was impaired in 22W Raf expressing cells treated with CCD ( data not shown ) .
For example , engagement of the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 and alphaLbeta2 has been shown to initially bind and subsequently promote the nuclear localization of the c-Jun coactivator , JAB1 , leading to enhanced activating protein 1 ( AP-1 ) transcriptional activity ( Bianchi et al. 2000 ) .
Finally , expression of active MEK failed to predominantly localize ERK to the nucleus in suspended cells or adherent cells treated with CCD .
Treatment of 22W Raf expressing cells with CCD significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation of Elk-1 in adherent cells ( XREF_FIG A , top ) .
In contrast , treatment of 22W Raf expressing cells with the microtubule disrupting agent , colchicine , did not inhibit Elk-1 phosphorylation at serine 383 ( XREF_FIG C ) .
By contrast , treatment with colchicine failed to abrogate 22W Raf mediated phosphorylation of Elk-1 , arguing against a requirement for an intact microtubule network in ERK translocation .
Upon mitogenic stimulation , ERK translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , where it phosphorylates the ternary complex factors Elk-1 and Sap-1a ( Chen et al. 1992 ; Gille et al. 1992 ; Lenormand et al. 1993 ) .
Expression of 22W Raf stimulated ERK phosphorylation of Elk-1 at serine 383 in adherent cells , but this effect was markedly reduced under suspension conditions ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Growth Factor mediated Phosphorylation of Elk-1 at Serine 383 Is Adhesion Dependent .
Integrin Mediated Adhesion Regulates ERK Nuclear Translocation and Phosphorylation of Elk-1 .
Higher magnification images confirmed that ERK was inefficiently translocated to the nucleus in nonadherent conditions ( XREF_FIG B ) . ++++ Upon mitogenic stimulation , ERK translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus , where it phosphorylates the ternary complex factors Elk-1 and Sap-1a ( Chen et al. 1992 ; Gille et al. 1992 ; Lenormand et al. 1993 ) . ++++ In these studies , macrophage stimulating protein showed reduced ERK activation and a further lack of detectable ERK translocation to the nucleus in suspended RE7 epithelial cells ; however , this study did not examine ERK translocation under conditions where high ERK activity is maintained in suspended cells . ++++ Perhaps the different results obtained by Roovers et al. 1999 and Le Gall et al. 1998 reflects the fact that ERK translocation to the nucleus is strongly dependent on integrin signaling in some cell lines , whereas it is less strictly dependent on integrin signaling in others . ++++ ERK translocation to the nucleus is essential for G1 phase progression ( Brunet et al. 1999 ) . ++++ However , it is also well established that ERK translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is required for G1 phase cell cycle progression .
This restoration of IRS-1 mRNA abundance by sustained rapamycin treatment is reversed by actinomycin D ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that mTOR and S6K1 signaling likely reduces IRS-1 mRNA abundance primarily at the level of gene transcription . ++++ Suppression of either S6K1 or S6K2 mimics the effect of rapamycin treatment and restores IRS-1 mRNA to a level approaching that of TSC2 +/+ MEFs ( XREF_FIG ) .
As a result of TSC1-2 loss of function , insulin like growth factors do not activate PI3K due to S6K inactivating the adaptor proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 .
The tuberous sclerosis complex ( TSC1-2 ) suppresses cell growth by negatively regulating a protein kinase , p70S6K ( S6K1 ) , which generally requires PI3K signals for its activation .
This restoration of IRS-1 mRNA abundance by sustained rapamycin treatment is reversed by actinomycin D ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that mTOR and S6K1 signaling likely reduces IRS-1 mRNA abundance primarily at the level of gene transcription .
As a result of TSC1-2 loss of function , insulin like growth factors do not activate PI3K due to S6K inactivating the adaptor proteins IRS-1 and IRS-2 .
Suppression of either S6K1 or S6K2 mimics the effect of rapamycin treatment and restores IRS-1 mRNA to a level approaching that of TSC2 +/+ MEFs ( XREF_FIG ) .
In control TSC2 +/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) or TSC2 -/- MEFs in which wild-type TSC2 has been reintroduced , PKB is activated by insulin , IGF-1 , and EGF ( XREF_FIG A ) . ++++ In contrast , in TSC2 -/- MEFs or TSC2 -/- MEFs in which a pathogenic TSC2 mutant is reintroduced , PKB is activated strongly only by EGF .
As a result of IRS inactivation , TSC2 deficient cells exhibit a profound defect in PI3K signaling and fail to activate the serine threonine kinase PKB or respond to the migration and pro survival activities of IGF-1 .
To determine whether perturbation of IRS function is the critical lesion responsible for diminished insulin signaling in TSC2 -/- MEFs , we then asked whether insulin signaling could be rescued in TSC2 -/- MEFs after overexpression of IRS-1 or IRS-2 .
Rapamycin treatment of TSC2 -/- MEFs relieves the suppression of IRS-1 mRNA abundance after ~ 24 h of treatment ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Our model ( XREF_FIG ) suggests that an explanation for the low level of malignancy observed in TSC1-2-deficient tumors may be that insufficient pro tumorigenic PIP3 dependent signals ( such as PKB activation ) are generated in TSC1-2-deficient tumor cells , and that such signals may be required for malignant conversion .
In control TSC2 +/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) or TSC2 -/- MEFs in which wild-type TSC2 has been reintroduced , PKB is activated by insulin , IGF-1 , and EGF ( XREF_FIG A ) .
We conclude that under the conditions of serum withdrawal , IGF-1 does not activate pro survival signaling in TSC2 deficient cells , and that a weaker pro survival signal is instead provided by mTOR and S6K signaling .
Our results argue that the low malignant potential of tumors arising from TSC1-2 dysfunction may be explained by the failure of TSC mutant cells to activate PI3K and its downstream effectors .
TSC1-2 promotes PI3K signaling by suppressing S6K , thereby preventing S6K dependent inactivation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 .
PI3K activation by insulin or IGF-1 is required for migration and chemotaxis and survival .
Consistent with the rescue of PKB activation , the elevation of PIP3 after IGF-1 stimulation of TSC2 -/- MEFs pretreated with rapamycin for 24 h is similar to that produced in stimulated TSC2 +/+ MEFs ( XREF_FIG D ) .
Pretreatment with rapamycin for 24 h has little effect on migration of TSC2 +/+ MEFs , but restores IGF stimulated migration of TSC2 -/- MEFs ( XREF_FIG ) .
TSC1-2 promotes insulin signaling by inhibiting S6K action on IRS-1 .
Rapamycin treatment of TSC2 -/- MEFs relieves the suppression of IRS-1 mRNA abundance after ~ 24 h of treatment ( XREF_FIG A ) .
In control TSC2 +/+ mouse embryo fibroblasts ( MEFs ) or TSC2 -/- MEFs in which wild-type TSC2 has been reintroduced , PKB is activated by insulin , IGF-1 , and EGF ( XREF_FIG A ) .
PI3K activation by insulin or IGF-1 is required for migration and chemotaxis and survival .
A connection between PTEN and TSC1-2 has also been proposed via PTEN loss of function leading to hyperactivation of the protein kinase PKB and AKT , which phosphorylates tuberin .
Thus , S6 kinases directly phosphorylate IRS-1 at Ser302 , and the resulting reduction of binding to insulin receptors is likely to play a major role in the inability of IRS-1 to signal to PI3K .
XREF_BIBR have also reported that IRS-1 is phosphorylated at Ser302 , by an unidentified nutrient- and rapamycin sensitive kinase .
The results show that only in IRS-1 108-516 in which serines 302 , 307 , and 310 are mutated ( XREF_FIG A , site 2 ) is IRS-1 not phosphorylated in vitro by S6K1 ( XREF_FIG C , left panels ) .
The beta5 deficient mice had a significant decrease in VEGF induced VP compared with control littermates ( XREF_FIG A ) ( P < 0.05 ) , which paralleled the loss of VP observed in src -/- mice . ++++ In combination with the reduction in VEGF induced VP ( XREF_FIG ) and neuronal damage in beta5 -/- mice , these results suggest a link between integrin alphavbeta5 and the Src dependent VEGF vascular response in vivo . ++++ Furthermore , the decrease in VEGF induced VP in these beta5 deficient mice was concomitant with a decrease in brain damage after cerebral ischemia ( XREF_FIG C ) . ++++ Although disruption of multiple SFKs with Src 251 blocks VEGF mediated angiogenesis , mice lacking a single SFK showed a selective loss of VEGF mediated VP , suggesting that multiple Src kinases can contribute to VEGF dependent angiogenesis , yet selective SFKs are important for VP .
However , inhibition of alphavbeta5 has no effect on VEGF stimulated Src kinase activity ( unpublished data ) . ++++ We find that VEGF stimulated Src activity in chick embryo blood vessels induces the coupling of focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) to integrin alphavbeta5 , a critical event in VEGF mediated signaling and biological responsiveness . ++++ These results provide genetic evidence in mice to corroborate the finding that the VEGF induced phosphorylation of FAK and the association of phosphorylated FAK with alphavbeta5 depend on VEGF mediated Src kinase activity . ++++ To substantiate the VEGF mediated Src requirement for the FAK and alphavbeta5 association , mice lacking pp60 c-src were injected with VEGF , and the injected tissues analyzed for FAK phosphorylation and assembly of the FAK and alphavbeta5 complex . ++++ These findings indicate that VEGF induced Src activity and the phosphorylation of Y861 in FAK contribute to the formation of a FAK and alphavbeta5 complex .
Src and FAK also associate with the cytoplasmic domain of growth factor receptors , and after integrin mediated cell adhesion , FAK can recruit Src to focal adhesions leading to Erk activation . ++++ Recent work from several laboratories indicates that Src and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) are activated by growth factor receptors and/or after integrin mediated cell adhesion . ++++ Although growth factors and integrin mediated cell adhesion are known to activate nonreceptor tyrosine kinases such as FAK and Src , the mechanisms by which growth factor induced biological processes in primary cells and tissues are regulated by integrins remains poorly understood .
Although the in vitro findings provide an important insight into the molecular basis of Src mediated FAK and alphavbeta5 interactions in the VEGF pathway , the functional requirement for integrin alphavbeta5 in a VEGF mediated vascular response remained unknown . ++++ Therefore , to further characterize the mechanism of the Src mediated FAK and alphavbeta5 interaction , in vitro binding studies were performed using NH 2 - or COOH-terminal domains of FAK and various full-length or truncated fusion proteins of beta5 and beta3 cytoplasmic tails .
Although disruption of multiple SFKs with Src 251 blocks VEGF mediated angiogenesis , mice lacking a single SFK showed a selective loss of VEGF mediated VP , suggesting that multiple Src kinases can contribute to VEGF dependent angiogenesis , yet selective SFKs are important for VP . ++++ Blockade of Src kinase activity or ligation of integrin alphavbeta5 disrupts VEGF mediated signaling and angiogenesis , yet it fails to influence bFGF mediated angiogenesis .
In combination with the biochemistry from endothelial cell immunoprecipitations and the in vitro binding assays , the lack of VEGF mediated VP from Src or beta5 knockout mice suggests that the VEGF induced formation of the FAK and alphavbeta5 complex may be an important mechanism for coordinating growth factor dependent integrin signaling during VEGF mediated VP .
Recent findings indicate that the FAK NT may be important for coordinating with growth factors receptors , whereas tyrosine phosphorylation of aa 861 in the FAK CT is increased during integrin mediated cell migration .
Recent studies indicate that VEGF promotes integrin dependent cell biological responses in vivo and in vitro , suggesting that the coordination of inputs from the extracellular matrix and growth factors are physiologically important .
FAK is found in focal contacts where it promotes downstream integrin mediated signals .
Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) promotes vascular permeability ( VP ) and neovascularization , and is required for development .
For example , alphavbeta5 mediated cell adhesion , migration and invasion requires prestimulation with growth factors .
In contrast , bFGF induced angiogenesis depends on the ligation of integrin alphavbeta3 , and is independent of Src kinase activity .
Recent work from several laboratories indicates that Src and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) are activated by growth factor receptors and/or after integrin mediated cell adhesion .
Recent work from several laboratories indicates that Src and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) are activated by growth factor receptors and/or after integrin mediated cell adhesion .
Recent work from several laboratories indicates that Src and focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) are activated by growth factor receptors and/or after integrin mediated cell adhesion .
Like the endothelial cell response to VEGF , epithelial cells such as HEK-293 formed a FAK and alphavbeta5 complex in response to EGF , which was blocked by the Src inhibitor , PP1 ( unpublished data ) .
In contrast , alphavbeta3 mediated cell migration and invasion in these cells are independent of growth factor stimulation .

Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) promotes vascular permeability ( VP ) and neovascularization , and is required for development .
These findings reveal that VEGF promotes a rapid but transient redistribution of FAK to focal contacts which parallels its activation kinetics , and the induction of downstream signaling to ERK .

For example , an autonomously expressed form of FAK lacking kinase activity , FAK related non kinase , suppresses VEGF induced angiogenesis ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that FAK may have an essential role in VEGF mediated vascular responses .
Whereas data in XREF_FIG demonstrates that VEGF stimulation leads to the phosphorylation of FAK on aa 397 and 861 ( XREF_FIG A ) and its localization in focal contacts ( XREF_FIG B ) , the capacity for phosphorylated FAK to coordinate with integrins in blood vessels is unknown . ++++ The VEGF induced Erk phosphorylation completely paralleled the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation , FAK activity and its subcellular translocation . ++++ The VEGF induced Erk phosphorylation completely paralleled the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation , FAK activity and its subcellular translocation . ++++ VEGF promotes FAK phosphorylation and translocation in endothelial cells . ++++ VEGF induces FAK phosphorylation and formation of a FAK and alphavbeta5 complex in cultured endothelial cells . ++++ The VEGF induced Erk phosphorylation completely paralleled the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation , FAK activity and its subcellular translocation . ++++ These results provide genetic evidence in mice to corroborate the finding that the VEGF induced phosphorylation of FAK and the association of phosphorylated FAK with alphavbeta5 depend on VEGF mediated Src kinase activity . ++++ The VEGF induced Erk phosphorylation completely paralleled the kinetics of FAK phosphorylation , FAK activity and its subcellular translocation .

Second , addition of cytochrome c failed to induce caspase-9 activation , caspase-3 processing , or PARP cleavage in extracts from cells expressing active Akt .
Subsequently , cytochrome c and dATP were added to initiate caspase activation .
For example , cytochrome c release induced by NGF withdrawal in sympathetic neurons is a reversible event , indicating that redistribution of cytochrome c into the cytosol does not always result in irreversible cell death in neurons ( Martinou et al. 1999 ) .
Since caspase-3 activation plays a central role in neuronal apoptosis , we examined caspase-3 activation and cleavage of its substrate , PARP , during ceramide induced apoptosis .
Our findings here indicate that Akt protects neural cells from acute apoptosis caused by cytochrome c release and may allow cytosolic cytochrome c to participate in other cellular process such as alpha-synuclein aggregation .
The cleaved p15 BID fragment translocates to mitochondria , where it causes release of cytochrome c , probably by changing the conformation of Bax ( Li et al. 1998 ; Luo et al. 1998 ; Desagher et al. 1999 ) .

However , unlike the observation that Akt upregulates Bcl-2 expression in BAF/3 cells ( Ahmed et al. 1997 ) , Akt promotes HMN1 cell survival in the absence of altering Bcl-2 , Bcl-X , and Bax expression , which is consistent with data from hippocampal H19-7 neuronal cells and epithelial BRK cells ( Eves et al. 1998 ; Sabbatini and McCormick 1999 ) .
After 18 h , LY 294002 induced ~ 50 % cell death , whereas PD 98059 had no obvious effect on cell survival ( XREF_FIG B ) .

Second , addition of cytochrome c failed to induce caspase-9 activation , caspase-3 processing , or PARP cleavage in extracts from cells expressing active Akt .
Consistent with LY 294002 but not PD 98059 inducing apoptosis in HMN1 cells , DNA laddering was observed only in LY 294002 treated cells ( XREF_FIG C ) .
Since caspase-9 is the initiator caspase for cleaving and activating caspase-3 , we examined whether caspase-9 activation by cytochrome c and dATP was inhibited in extracts prepared from Akt-stable lines ( XREF_FIG D ) .
The cleaved p15 BID fragment translocates to mitochondria , where it causes release of cytochrome c , probably by changing the conformation of Bax ( Li et al. 1998 ; Luo et al. 1998 ; Desagher et al. 1999 ) .
Depending on the type of neuron , either PI 3-kinase or MAP kinase can promote cell survival ( Pettmann and Henderson 1998 ) .
A recent study ( Kennedy et al. 1999 ) indicates that Akt inhibits the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria after UV irradiation , which may involve activation of cell-surface Fas receptor ( Rehemtulla et al. 1997 ; Aragane et al. 1998 ) . ++++ It has been speculated that Akt inhibits apoptosis by maintaining Bcl-x function and preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria . ++++ Akt phosphorylates and inactivates BAD , which may maintain Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function , and it has been suggested that Akt inhibits cell death by preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria ( Kennedy et al. 1999 ) .
Our data indicate that Akt inhibits apoptosis downstream of cytochrome c release based on the following observations : ( a ) Akt inhibits cell death but does not block release of cytochrome c , ( b ) Akt inhibits cytochrome c induced caspase activation in a cell free assay , and ( c ) HMN1 cells expressing active Akt are resistant to apoptosis induced by microinjection of cytochrome c . ++++ Third , addition of active Akt to lysates from control cells blocked cytochrome c induced caspase activation .
Therefore , NGF signaling appears to block cytochrome c induced apoptosis in sympathetic neurons .
This decreases the binding of Bad to Bcl-xL at the mitochondrial membrane and increases its binding to 14-3-3 in the cytosol ( Zha et al. 1996 ; Datta et al. 1997 ) .
In HMN1 cells , PD 98059 blocked serum stimulated ERK phosphorylation at threonine-202 and tyrosine-204 , indicating effective inhibition of MEK1 , and LY 294002 blocked serum- and insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 , indicating effective inhibition of PI 3-kinase ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Our current study as well as work by others suggests that caspase activation is required for ceramide induced apoptosis and that ceramide induced apoptosis can be suppressed by either constitutively active Akt or Bcl-2 , probably by different cellular mechanisms .

We previously showed that transient expression of constitutively active Akt inhibits ceramide induced death of hybrid motor neuron 1 cells .
Interestingly , zVAD-fmk did not block cytochrome c release from the mitochondria ( XREF_FIG C ) , even though it inhibited caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) .
Akt phosphorylates Apaf-1 in vitro ( our unpublished observations ) ; however , further studies are needed to determine whether cellular Apaf-1 is a direct target of Akt , and how the phosphorylation status of Apaf-1 may regulate caspase-9 activation .
However , [ 32 P ] orthophosphate labeling of cells expressing active Akt indicated that mouse caspase-9 is not phosphorylated by Akt ( data not shown ) .
However , unlike the observation that Akt upregulates Bcl-2 expression in BAF/3 cells ( Ahmed et al. 1997 ) , Akt promotes HMN1 cell survival in the absence of altering Bcl-2 , Bcl-X , and Bax expression , which is consistent with data from hippocampal H19-7 neuronal cells and epithelial BRK cells ( Eves et al. 1998 ; Sabbatini and McCormick 1999 ) .
While each of these has been implicated as an important target for Akt to inhibit apoptosis , in the present case , caspase-9 appears to be the most likely candidate since Akt phosphorylates human caspase-9 and inhibits its activity ( Cardone et al. 1998 ) , which would provide a potential mechanism for Akt to inhibit caspase activation at a postmitochondrial level .
In HMN1 cells , PD 98059 blocked serum stimulated ERK phosphorylation at threonine-202 and tyrosine-204 , indicating effective inhibition of MEK1 , and LY 294002 blocked serum- and insulin stimulated Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 , indicating effective inhibition of PI 3-kinase ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Akt phosphorylates and inactivates BAD , which may maintain Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function , and it has been suggested that Akt inhibits cell death by preventing cytochrome c release from mitochondria ( Kennedy et al. 1999 ) .
Upon activation by PI 3-kinase , Akt phosphorylates Bad at Ser136 .
Constitutively Active Akt Inhibits Apoptosis After Microinjection of Cytochrome c. To determine whether Akt inhibits cytochrome c induced apoptosis in vivo , purified cytochrome c was microinjected into the cytoplasm of Akt expressing and vector transfected cells .
Akt inhibits apoptosis induced by microinjection of cytochrome c and lysates from cells expressing active Akt inhibit cytochrome c induced caspase activation in a cell-free assay while lysates from Bcl-2-expressing cells have no effect .
This observation is in agreement with the well established role for Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis by blocking cytochrome c release from mitochondria ( Kluck et al. 1997 ; Yang et al. 1997 ) .
As expected , 100 muM CKI-7 ( even in the presence of 10 nM Tcf3 ) actually accelerates the rate of degradation of beta-catenin in extracts compared with a buffer control . ++++ We show that the inhibition of beta-catenin degradation by Tcf3 protein has physiological relevance , since a significant fraction of the total Tcf protein resides in the cytoplasm in Xenopus eggs and early embryos and in cultured 293 cells . ++++ We demonstrate that Tcf3 can inhibit beta-catenin turnover via its competition with axin and adenomatous polyposis for beta-catenin binding .
Failure of GSK3 to inhibit the effects of Tcf3 in our earlier experiments ( XREF_FIG B ) was probably due to the high concentration of Tcf3 ( 1 muM ) used . ++++ Our initial experiments indicated that GSK3 does not readily reverse the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 at high concentration ( 1 muM ) , but subsequent experiments revealed that GSK3 reverses the effect of Tcf3 at lower concentrations that are close to the IC 50 of Tcf3 for beta-catenin degradation .
As expected , 100 muM CKI-7 ( even in the presence of 10 nM Tcf3 ) actually accelerates the rate of degradation of beta-catenin in extracts compared with a buffer control . ++++ Studies with the CK1epsilon inhibitor CKI-7 ( XREF_FIG C ) indicate that CK1epsilon regulates the formation of the beta , catenin , and Tcf3 complex : CKI-7 blocks the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 on beta-catenin degradation and therefore increases the rate of beta-catenin degradation above basal levels .
In previous studies , injections of CKI-7 did not block the effects of overexpressed beta-catenin in Xenopus embryos , which suggested that CK1epsilon acts upstream of beta-catenin .
Tcf3 synergizes with CK1epsilon to inhibit beta-catenin degradation , whereas CKI-7 , an inhibitor of CK1epsilon , reduces the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 .
Loss of APC function would not only result in an increase in the amount of free beta-catenin available to bind Tcf3 but would also allow Tcf3 to compete effectively with axin for beta-catenin binding .
Although Tcf3 binds GSK3 , it does not inhibit the activity of GSK3 against axin ( XREF_FIG D ) .
Polyubiquitin conjugates of beta-catenin are rapidly degraded by the proteasome .
In addition , CKI-7 blocks the effect of Tcf3 in a dose dependent manner in Xenopus extracts ( XREF_FIG B ) .
It should be noted that the concentrations of CKI-7 used in our in vitro experiments is 10-fold greater than in these experiments and is still only sufficient to inhibit 50 % of the CK1 activity .
Addition of the Tcf4 NH 2 -terminal peptide to Xenopus extracts stimulated the degradation of beta-catenin by ~ 65 % ( XREF_FIG C ) , further demonstrating that Tcf proteins are normally involved in modulating beta-catenin degradation .

Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear , these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces . ++++ A dominant negative dsh mutant ( Xdd1 ) that lacks the putative CK1epsilon binding domain ( PDZ domain ) fails to block the ability of CK1epsilon to stimulate wnt signaling in vivo , a result inconsistent with a model in which CK1epsilon mediates wnt signaling by binding to the PDZ domain of dsh .
Our initial experiments indicated that GSK3 does not readily reverse the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 at high concentration ( 1 muM ) , but subsequent experiments revealed that GSK3 reverses the effect of Tcf3 at lower concentrations that are close to the IC 50 of Tcf3 for beta-catenin degradation . ++++ 1 muM of purified GSK3 ( XREF_FIG B ) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 ( 1 muM ) on beta-catenin degradation , suggesting that the effect of Tcf3 was not due to titration of GSK3 .
Tcf3 synergizes with CK1epsilon to inhibit beta-catenin degradation , whereas CKI-7 , an inhibitor of CK1epsilon , reduces the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 . ++++ Studies with the CK1epsilon inhibitor CKI-7 ( XREF_FIG C ) indicate that CK1epsilon regulates the formation of the beta , catenin , and Tcf3 complex : CKI-7 blocks the inhibitory effect of Tcf3 on beta-catenin degradation and therefore increases the rate of beta-catenin degradation above basal levels .
As shown in XREF_FIG C , preincubation of Tcf3 beads with CK1epsilon increases their affinity for beta-catenin nearly fourfold compared with untreated beads .
Along with evidence that a significant amount of Tcf protein is nonnuclear , these findings suggest that CK1epsilon can modulate wnt signaling in vivo by regulating both the beta-catenin-Tcf3 and the GBP-dsh interfaces .
Paradoxically , high concentrations ( > 2 muM ) of cat449/645 inhibited beta-catenin degradation ( unpublished data ) , probably reflecting the ability of high concentrations of this mutant to compete with wild-type beta-catenin for binding to APC ( XREF_FIG D ) .
Dsh acts synergistically with CK1epsilon to inhibit beta-catenin degradation in Xenopus extracts ( XREF_FIG B ) , consistent with the in vivo results .
As expected , GBP acts synergistically with CK1epsilon to inhibit beta-catenin degradation ( XREF_FIG D ) .
However , in vertebrates CBP has been shown to bind to the COOH-terminal region of beta-catenin to activate Tcf mediated gene transcription .
A dominant negative dsh mutant ( Xdd1 ) that lacks the putative CK1epsilon binding domain ( PDZ domain ) fails to block the ability of CK1epsilon to stimulate wnt signaling in vivo , a result inconsistent with a model in which CK1epsilon mediates wnt signaling by binding to the PDZ domain of dsh .

This model helps explain why insulin growth factor ( IGF ) 1 can enhance the stability of beta-catenin but not transcriptional activation of downstream targets , whereas addition of the GSK3 inhibitor lithium resulted in a dramatic increase in beta-catenin-Tcf-mediated transcriptional activation .
A more careful examination showed that excess GSK3 could partially rescue the inhibition of beta-catenin degradation by lower levels of Tcf3 ( 100 nM ) ; however , even a large excess of GSK3 did not reverse the effect of 300 nM added Tcf3 ( XREF_FIG ) .
The failure of Tcf3 to block beta-catenin binding to axin in the presence of APCm3 highlights the strong effect of APC in driving the degradation of free beta-catenin by promoting its binding to axin and in inhibiting competing reactions driven by Tcf3 . ++++ In the present study , we show that Tcf3 inhibits the interaction between beta-catenin and axin and APC and that Tcf3 and beta-catenin interact significantly even in the absence of wnt signaling to modulate beta-catenin turnover .
A human Tcf4 NH 2 -terminal peptide blocked the binding of beta-catenin to Tcf3 beads ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Some members of the Sox family of HMG box proteins also bind beta-catenin and block its binding to Tcf .
Based on experiments with this mutant , we defined a fragment of beta-catenin ( cat449/645 ) that can disrupt the interaction between beta-catenin and Tcf but not the interaction of beta-catenin with axin and APC .
In the present study , we show that Tcf3 inhibits the interaction between beta-catenin and axin and APC and that Tcf3 and beta-catenin interact significantly even in the absence of wnt signaling to modulate beta-catenin turnover .
Since cat449/645 below 2 muM blocks the interaction between beta-catenin and Tcf3 without affecting the interaction between beta-catenin and axin and APC , we tested its effect on the rate of beta-catenin degradation .
5 muM Tcf3 strongly inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 but had no effect on the phosphorylation of axin ( XREF_FIG D ) .
Some members of the Sox family of HMG box proteins also bind beta-catenin and block its binding to Tcf .
In the present study , we show that Tcf3 inhibits the interaction between beta-catenin and axin and APC and that Tcf3 and beta-catenin interact significantly even in the absence of wnt signaling to modulate beta-catenin turnover .
Phosphorylation of Tcf3 was suppressed by 100 mM LiCl ( a direct inhibitor of GSK3 ) to the reaction ( XREF_FIG A ) , which suggested that endogenous GSK3 copurified with recombinant his 6 -Tcf3 from Sf9 cells .

Some members of the Sox family of HMG box proteins also bind beta-catenin and block its binding to Tcf .
Binding of GBP to GSK3 inhibits its kinase activity against beta-catenin , reducing its degradation by the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex and resulting in a increased steady state level of free beta-catenin .
However , unlike full-length beta-catenin , this interaction is not blocked by 1 muM Tcf3 added to the extracts ( unpublished data ) .
Furthermore , the enhanced Tcf3 phosphorylation by CK1epsilon is partially inhibited when CKI-7 ( IC 50 , 10-30 muM ; purchased from Seikagaku Corporation ) , a selective inhibitor of CK1 activity , is included in the kinase reaction . ++++ The simplest model consistent with these experimental results is that phosphorylation of Tcf3 by CK1epsilon promotes the interaction of Tcf3 with beta-catenin . ++++ As with GSK3 , CK1epsilon can phosphorylate recombinant Tcf3 in vitro .
beta-catenin and axin are phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro , and beta-catenin phosphorylation is stimulated greatly by axin . ++++ Within this complex , beta-catenin is brought in the proximity of and is phosphorylated by GSK3 . ++++ Phosphorylation of beta-catenin by GSK3 is required for beta-catenin degradation .

Tcf3 is a substrate for both glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK ) 3 and casein kinase ( CK ) 1epsilon , and phosphorylation of Tcf3 by CKIepsilon stimulates its binding to beta-catenin , an effect reversed by GSK3 .
This result indicates that in addition to promoting the association between Tcf3 and beta-catenin , CK1epsilon stimulates the binding of GBP to dsh .
Mutating the GSK3 phosphorylation sites ( serine to alanine ) in the NH 2 -terminal region of beta-cateninDeltaC1 and beta-cateninDeltaC2 stabilized these proteins against degradation in extracts ( unpublished data ) , further demonstrating that the stability of beta-cateninDeltaC1 and beta-cateninDeltaC2 is regulated similarly to wild-type beta-catenin .
Increases in beta-catenin levels mediated by IGF-1 may not be sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effect of GSK3 on beta-catenin-Tcf interaction .
A purified 100-kD fragment of APC ( APCm3 ) that spans the axin and beta-catenin binding sites stimulates binding of beta-catenin to axin beads ( XREF_FIG B ) .
beta-catenin and axin are phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro , and beta-catenin phosphorylation is stimulated greatly by axin .
Additionally , we provide evidence that CKIepsilon stimulates the interaction between dsh and GBP .
In C. elegans , the LIT-1 protein phosphorylates POP-1 , a Tcf/LEF related protein , to downregulate its activity .
Using a biochemical approach , we have revealed an additional role for GSK3 in the wnt pathway that may account for these discrepancies : GSK3 phosphorylates Tcf3 thereby decreasing its affinity for beta-catenin and antagonizing the activity of CK1epsilon .
Tcf3 is a substrate for both glycogen synthase kinase ( GSK ) 3 and casein kinase ( CK ) 1epsilon , and phosphorylation of Tcf3 by CKIepsilon stimulates its binding to beta-catenin , an effect reversed by GSK3 .
Tcf3 inhibits both beta-catenin degradation and phosphorylation by GSK3 .

XREF_BIBR In this nonclassical model ( Fig XREF_FIG ) , NF-kappa B activation is delayed for hours following stimulus , and activation is thought to result from p90RSK phosphorylation of Ikappa B and/or p65 .

In particular , the protein tyrosine kinase ( PTK ) inhibitor , Imatinib ( Gleevec , STI571 ) synergises with rapamycin to inhibit BCR and ABL transformed cells ( Mohi et al , 2004 ) .

mTOR enhances translation initiation in part by phosphorylating two major targets , the eIF4E binding proteins ( 4E-BPs ) and the ribosomal protein S6 kinases ( S6K1 and S6K2 ) that cooperate to regulate translation initiation rates .
PDK1 and the Ser/Thr kinase Akt are recruited to the membrane where PDK1 phosphorylates and activates Akt .
Although the activity of the rictor and mTOR complex is insensitive to short periods of rapamycin treatment , it has been suggested that long-term exposure to rapamycin could prevent newly synthesised mTOR molecules from associating with rictor , thereby preventing rictor and mTOR mediated Akt phosphorylation ( Guertin and Sabatini , 2005 ) .
The translation initiation factor eIF4B , which stimulates the activity of eIF4A in unwinding duplex RNA , is phosphorylated by S6K1 on serine 422 ( Raught et al , 2004 ) .
The SRE was preferentially activated by C-Raf , a component of the ERK cascade , while the DSE promoter responded better to RhoA , which triggers an Elk-1 independent pathway involving the SRF co-activator MAL and MKL -1 ( XREF_FIG d ) .
Mitogen induced recruitment of ERK and MSK to SRE promoter complexes by ternary complex factor Elk-1 .
The SRE was preferentially activated by C-Raf , a component of the ERK cascade , while the DSE promoter responded better to RhoA , which triggers an Elk-1 independent pathway involving the SRF co-activator MAL and MKL -1 ( XREF_FIG d ) .
Stable associations between substrates and ERK involving both the D domain and KIM and FxFP motif have been demonstrated and a dual interaction model has been proposed based on structural analyses of ERK and MKP3 and Elk-1-derived peptides whereby docking is initiated by the D domain and KIM and subsequent favourable orientation of phosphorylation sites determined by the FxFP motif .
For example , we observed promoter specific differences in pS5-CTD levels and confirmed that recombinant CTD can be phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro , but phosphorylation of S5-CTD in PICs was not blocked by ERK inhibitors .
TPA also stimulated H3S10 phosphorylation over the egr-1 promoter but not over the gene ( XREF_FIG d ) .
TPA stimulation transiently increased the level of phospho-Elk-1 at the egr-1 promoter ( XREF_FIG a , lanes 9-12 ) , which correlated with an increase in MED1 recruitment ( lanes 13-16 ) .
Furthermore , Elk-1 knockdown also prevented ERK and MSK recruitment to the egr-1 promoter ( XREF_FIG c ) .
Elk-1 knockdown prevents recruitment of ERK and MSK to c-fos and egr-1 promoters .
The expression of the immediate early ( IE ) genes c-fos and egr-1 ( also known as NGFI-A , zif/268 and Krox24 ) is triggered by mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signalling .
An Elk-1 mutant lacking both docking sites ( dbl ) was not phosphorylated by ERK2 under these conditions .
Binding of SRF to the SRE , but not the DSE , is enhanced by Elk-1 , as reported earlier .
Elk-1 is phosphorylated by ERKs ( also JNK and SAPKs and p38MAPK isoforms ) and recruited to the c-fos SRE , but during mitogen induced c-fos expression , events following Elk-1 phosphorylation are less well understood .
For example , we observed promoter specific differences in pS5-CTD levels and confirmed that recombinant CTD can be phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro , but phosphorylation of S5-CTD in PICs was not blocked by ERK inhibitors .
Activated ERK1 and ERK2 can phosphorylate a variety of nuclear substrates such as the transcription factors Elk-1 , Ets1 and Sap1a , and also cytosolic targets such as phospholipase A2 , and S6 Kinase p90 rsk among others ( Widmann et al , 1999 ) .

The most well established mechanism by which MeCP2 is able to repress transcription involves the recruitment of co-repressor complexes containing histone deacetylases that are able to alter chromatin structure . ++++ Kaludov and Wolffe demonstrated that MeCP2 is still able to repress transcription in vitro in the absence of histones by interacting with transcription factor IIB ( TFIIB ) to prevent assembly of the pre and initiation complex . ++++ If MeCP2 is indeed able to activate as well as repress transcription , it will be interesting to identify which regions of the MeCP2 protein are involved in the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators and how MeCP2 is able to specifically recruit co-repressors in some instances and co-activators in others .
miR132 is induced by BDNF and CREB-1 , which are both targets of MeCP2 mediated gene regulation ( XREF_TABLE ) , suggesting that miR132 may be involved in feedback loops regulating MeCP2 protein levels ( 82 ) .

The inhibition of mTOR by PP242 and PP30 also resulted in loss of Akt phosphorylation at T308 , but significantly higher doses of PP242 and PP30 were required to inhibit T308 as compared with S473 ( XREF_FIG A and XREF_FIG B ) . ++++ PP242 and PP30 inhibit mTOR in vitro with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ( IC 50 values ) of 8 nM and 80 nM , respectively . ++++ As expected for active-site inhibitors , PP242 and PP30 inhibit mTOR in both mTORC1 and mTORC2 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .

The enhanced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 caused by PP242 as compared with rapamycin could be due to incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or involvement of mTORC2 in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 . ++++ The ability of PP242 to block cell proliferation more efficiently than rapamycin could be a result of its ability to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 , because rapamycin can only inhibit mTORC1 .
Despite an increase in p4EBP1 in SIN1 -/- compared with wild-type MEFs , shorter exposures of the p4EBP1 blots ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY B ) show that PP242 inhibits p4EBP1 with the same potency in both cells . ++++ The fuller inhibition of p4EBP1 by PP242 than by rapamycin in wild-type and SIN1 -/- MEFs indicates that the presence of mTORC2 is not required for rapamycin and PP242 to have distinct effects on 4EBP1 phosphorylation , and suggests that PP242 is a more complete inhibitor of mTORC1 than rapamycin .
PP242 Inhibits Proliferation More Completely Than Rapamycin . ++++ The ability of PP242 to block cell proliferation more efficiently than rapamycin could be a result of its ability to inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 , because rapamycin can only inhibit mTORC1 .
PP242 inhibited S473-P and T308-P at both early and late time points after insulin stimulation , indicating that the differential sensitivity of these sites to PP242 does not reflect differing kinetics of phosphorylation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ As a further test of the specificity of PP242 and the requirement for functional S473 phosphorylation in order for PP242 to inhibit T308-P , we examined the effect of PP242 on the phosphorylation of Akt in primary MEFs from embryos that lack SIN1 [ XREF_BIBR ] ( XREF_FIG B ) .
The lack of effect of PP242 on S473A Akt confirms that PP242 inhibition of pT308 requires S473 and also that PP242 does not inhibit PDK1 in cells , as was suggested by direct testing of PDK1 in vitro ( XREF_FIG ) .
Active-Site Inhibitors of mTOR Target Rapamycin Resistant Outputs of mTORC1 and mTORC2 .

Active-Site Inhibitors of mTOR Target Rapamycin Resistant Outputs of mTORC1 and mTORC2 .
Rapamycin caused partial inhibition of the insulin stimulated release of 4EPB1 from eIF4E ( XREF_FIG A ) , consistent with its partial inhibition of S65 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG A ) .
In these assays , PP242 was relatively inactive against PKC-beta , RET , or JAK2 but inhibited PKC-alpha with an in vitro IC 50 of 50 nM ( XREF_FIG ) .
Importantly , at the molecular level , PP242 inhibits cap dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect .
Unlike rapamycin , these molecules inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 , and , unlike PI3K family inhibitors such as LY294002 , these molecules inhibit mTOR with a high degree of selectivity relative to PI3Ks and protein kinases .
PP242 inhibited S473-P and T308-P at both early and late time points after insulin stimulation , indicating that the differential sensitivity of these sites to PP242 does not reflect differing kinetics of phosphorylation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Rapamycin caused partial inhibition of the insulin stimulated release of 4EPB1 from eIF4E ( XREF_FIG A ) , consistent with its partial inhibition of S65 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Based on this assay , inhibition of mTOR and p4EBP1 reduces cap dependent translation by about 30 % , suggesting that cap dependent translation is only partially inhibited by hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 .
Based on this assay , inhibition of mTOR and p4EBP1 reduces cap dependent translation by about 30 % , suggesting that cap dependent translation is only partially inhibited by hypophosphorylated 4EBP1 .
Growth factor stimulation of PI3K causes activation of Akt by phosphorylation at two key sites : the activation loop ( T308 ) and the C-terminal hydrophobic motif ( S473 ) .
In contrast to Akt , which maintains T308-P , SGK activity is completely inhibited by genetic disruption of mTORC2 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
PP242 caused a significant decrease in cap dependent , but not IRES dependent ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , translation , whereas rapamycin did not have a statistically significant effect on cap dependent translation ( XREF_FIG B ) , consistent with the modest effect of rapamycin on 4EBP1 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Active Akt promotes cell survival in many ways , including suppressing apoptosis , promoting glucose uptake , and modifying cellular metabolism [ XREF_BIBR ] ; consequently , there is significant interest in identifying the kinase ( s ) responsible for each activating phosphorylation , the relationship between these phosphorylation sites , and the role of differential Akt phosphorylation on Akt substrate phosphorylation .
The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR in response to growth factor and nutrient status causes it to dissociate from eIF4E allowing eIF4G and associated factors to bind to the 5 ' cap , recruit the 40S subunit of the ribosome , and scan the mRNA for the start codon to initiate translation .
In contrast to PIK-90 and Akti-1/2 , which completely inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and its direct substrates , PP242 only partially inhibited the phosphorylation of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates of Akt . ++++ Akt Substrate Phosphorylation Is Only Modestly Inhibited by PP242 . ++++ Surprisingly , PP242 was only partially able to inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt in skeletal muscle and was more effective at inhibiting the phosphorylation of T308 than S473 , despite it 's ability to fully inhibit the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6 .
Both rapamycin and PP242 inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K and its substrate S6 , and neither rapamycin nor PP242 affected the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on T70 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY A ) . ++++ S6 phosphorylation was fully inhibited by rapamycin and PP242 in all tissues examined .
Both rapamycin and PP242 inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K and its substrate S6 , and neither rapamycin nor PP242 affected the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on T70 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY A ) . ++++ S6 phosphorylation was fully inhibited by rapamycin and PP242 in all tissues examined .
Because rapamycin can only partially inhibit the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 , but it can fully in inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K , rapamycin appears to be a substrate selective inhibitor of mTORC1 . ++++ Because rapamycin can only partially inhibit the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 , but it can fully in inhibit the phosphorylation of S6K , rapamycin appears to be a substrate selective inhibitor of mTORC1 .
From these data , we conclude that PP242 's effect on T308-P is dependent on its inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by mTOR at S473 .
Treatment of cells with PP30 was also effective at reducing the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , indicating that the block of T36/45 phosphorylation by PP242 is due to its inhibition of mTOR and not PKC-alpha .
We compared PP242 to the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 and the allosteric Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2 [ XREF_BIBR ] , which inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at both sites .
Because Akti-1/2 does not inhibit SGK [ XREF_BIBR ] but inhibits FoxO1 and O3a phosphorylation at T24 and T32 in L6 myotubes ( XREF_FIG ) , our data suggests that the major kinase for T24 and T32 of FoxO1 and O3a in L6 myotubes is Akt and not SGK .
By comparison , the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 , which does not inhibit mTOR , inhibited the phosphorylation of both Akt sites equipotently ( XREF_FIG B ) , as observed previously [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In fat and liver , PP242 was able to completely inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and T308 , consistent with its effect on these phosphorylation sites observed in cell culture .
In fat and liver , PP242 was able to completely inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and T308 , consistent with its effect on these phosphorylation sites observed in cell culture .
PP242 and PP30 both inhibited insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473 , confirming that mTOR kinase activity is required for hydrophobic motif phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG A ) .
In contrast , PP242 fully inhibited the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 and S65 , whereas rapamycin only had a modest affect on these same phosphorylations .
PP242 and PP30 both inhibited insulin stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at S473 , confirming that mTOR kinase activity is required for hydrophobic motif phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG A ) .
While PP242 was effective at blocking the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 on both T36/45 and S65 in all tissues examined , rapamycin did not block 4EBP1 phosphorylation as completely as PP242 .
The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR in response to growth factor and nutrient status causes it to dissociate from eIF4E allowing eIF4G and associated factors to bind to the 5 ' cap , recruit the 40S subunit of the ribosome , and scan the mRNA for the start codon to initiate translation . ++++ By contrast , LY294002 , a direct inhibitor of many PI3K family members including mTOR , was equally effective at inhibiting the phosphorylation of S6K and 4EBP1 by mTOR in vitro [ XREF_BIBR ] and in cells [ XREF_BIBR ] , although this finding is complicated by LY294002 's inhibition of multiple lipid and protein kinases [ XREF_BIBR ] including PIM , a kinase potentially upstream of 4EBP1 phosphorylation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ The phosphorylation of 4EBP1 by mTOR is complicated in that it occurs at multiple sites , and not all sites are equally effective at causing dissociation of 4EBP1 from eIF4E [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Because SGK can phosphorylate FoxO and its activity is completely inhibited by disruption of mTORC2 , it was suggested that the loss of FoxO phosphorylation in SIN1 -/- MEFs indicates that FoxO is primarily phosphorylated by SGK rather than Akt [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Because SGK can phosphorylate FoxO and its activity is completely inhibited by disruption of mTORC2 , it was suggested that the loss of FoxO phosphorylation in SIN1 -/- MEFs indicates that FoxO is primarily phosphorylated by SGK rather than Akt [ XREF_BIBR ] .
It can not be inferred from this genetic data whether acute pharmacological inhibition of mTORC2 would block the phosphorylation of Akt only at S473 , resulting in partial Akt deactivation , or also disrupt phosphorylation at T308 , resulting complete Akt inhibition . ++++ Genetic studies have suggested that mTORC2 may phosphorylate Akt at S473 , one of two phosphorylation sites required for Akt activation ; this has been controversial , in part because RNA interference and gene knockouts produce distinct Akt phospho-isoforms .
Unlike rapamycin , these TORKinibs ( PP242 and PP30 ) inhibit mTORC2 , and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation . ++++ We have shown through the use of these inhibitors that the inhibition of mTOR kinase activity is sufficient to prevent the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 , providing further evidence that mTORC2 is the kinase responsible for Akt hydrophobic motif phosphorylation upon insulin stimulation .
PIK-90 did not reduce the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 , demonstrating that inhibition of PI3K and Akt activation alone is not sufficient to block the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
In all tissues examined , and especially in fat and muscle , acute rapamycin treatment activated the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and T308 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Because SGK can phosphorylate FoxO and its activity is completely inhibited by disruption of mTORC2 , it was suggested that the loss of FoxO phosphorylation in SIN1 -/- MEFs indicates that FoxO is primarily phosphorylated by SGK rather than Akt [ XREF_BIBR ] .
PP242 caused a higher level of binding between 4EBP1 and eIF4E than rapamycin ( XREF_FIG A ) , suggesting that cap dependent translation will be more highly suppressed by PP242 than by rapamycin .
Because Akti-1/2 does not inhibit SGK [ XREF_BIBR ] but inhibits FoxO1 and O3a phosphorylation at T24 and T32 in L6 myotubes ( XREF_FIG ) , our data suggests that the major kinase for T24 and T32 of FoxO1 and O3a in L6 myotubes is Akt and not SGK .

Treatment of cells with PP30 was also effective at reducing the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , indicating that the block of T36/45 phosphorylation by PP242 is due to its inhibition of mTOR and not PKC-alpha .

We compared PP242 to the PI3K inhibitor PIK-90 and the allosteric Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2 [ XREF_BIBR ] , which inhibit the phosphorylation of Akt at both sites .
Rapamycin often stimulates the phosphorylation of Akt [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , probably by relieving feedback inhibition from S6K to the insulin receptor substrate 1 ( IRS1 ) [ XREF_BIBR ] , a key signaling molecule that links activation of the insulin receptor to PI3K activation .
PIK-90 did not reduce the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 , demonstrating that inhibition of PI3K and Akt activation alone is not sufficient to block the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 at T36/45 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
The enhanced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 caused by PP242 as compared with rapamycin could be due to incomplete inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or involvement of mTORC2 in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 .
The PI3K and Akt pathway must be activated in G1 to inactivate forkhead transcription factors and allow cell cycle entry . ++++ Akt triggers a network that positively regulates G1/S cell cycle progression through inactivation of GSK3beta , leading to increased cyclin D1 , and inhibition of Forkhead family transcription factors and the tumor suppressor tuberin ( TSC2 ) , leading to reduction of p27 ( Kip1 ) [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The PI3K and Akt pathway must be activated in G1 to inactivate forkhead transcription factors and allow cell cycle entry . ++++ HIF-1-dependent gene transcription was blocked by dominant negative Akt or PI3K and by wild-type PTEN , whereas transcription was stimulated by constitutively active Akt or dominant negative PTEN [ XREF_BIBR ] .

PTEN antagonized the activation of PKB and Akt by growth factors , by activated PI3K and by PDK1 , but did not antagonize the phospholipid independent activation of PKB and Akt lacking the PH domain [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Transfection of PTEN into the PTEN negative decreased the activation of Akt and the downstream p70 ( S6K ) and reversed the resistance to doxorubicin in these cells , indicating that changes in PTEN status and Akt activation modulate the cellular response to doxorubicin [ XREF_BIBR ] .
These findings were supported by studies showing that Ras activation of PI3K suppresses c-Myc-induced apoptosis through the activation of Akt but not p70 ( S6K ) [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ These data showed that apoptosis induced by blockade of the PI3K pathway in prostate tumor cells is mediated by an autocrine Fas and FasL apoptotic mechanism and that the Fas apoptotic pathway is both necessary and sufficient to mediate apoptosis by PI3K inhibition [ XREF_BIBR ] .
In another study , KP-372-1 and KP-372-2 effectively inhibited the PI3K and Akt signaling cascade in glioblastoma [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ KP372-1 blocked signalling downstream of Akt in thyroid tumour cells , leading to inhibition of cell proliferation and increased apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The PI3K and Akt pathway must be activated in G1 to inactivate forkhead transcription factors and allow cell cycle entry . ++++ Akt triggers a network that positively regulates G1/S cell cycle progression through inactivation of GSK3beta , leading to increased cyclin D1 , and inhibition of Forkhead family transcription factors and the tumor suppressor tuberin ( TSC2 ) , leading to reduction of p27 ( Kip1 ) [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Furthermore , LY294002 suppressed cell proliferation and , at higher doses , induced marked apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells .
Another study demonstrated synergistic augmentation of the cytotoxicity by LY294002 occurs specifically with antimicrotubule agents , at least partially through an increase in caspase 3 dependent apoptosis , and suggested that inhibitors of the PI3K and Akt pathway in combination with antimicrotubule agents may induce cell death effectively and be a potent modality to treat patients with malignant gliomas [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Transfection of PTEN into the PTEN negative decreased the activation of Akt and the downstream p70 ( S6K ) and reversed the resistance to doxorubicin in these cells , indicating that changes in PTEN status and Akt activation modulate the cellular response to doxorubicin [ XREF_BIBR ] .

The PI3K and Akt pathway must be activated in G1 to inactivate forkhead transcription factors and allow cell cycle entry .
The results suggested that loss of PTEN , by permitting a high level of Akt activity independent of RTK inputs , can temporally dissociate the inhibition of the EGFR with that of Akt induced by EGFR inhibitors [ XREF_BIBR ] .

In this context , our findings that rapamycin , via the Src mediated transactivation of the EGFR and activation of its downstream kinases Erk1/2 and RSK increases cell survival , may represent an additional mechanism of drug resistance in certain forms of tumors .

The observation that the c-Src kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibits rapamycin- elicited EGFR phosphorylation suggests that c-Src is upstream of the EGFR .
Consistent with the notion that cSrc is upstream of the EGFR , our findings also show that although the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 , inhibited EGFR autophosphorylation on Y1173 ( not shown ) and Erk1/2 as well as RSK activation ( XREF_FIG ) , the activation of c-Src by rapamycin was not altered ( XREF_FIG ) ; these data also demonstrate that AG1478 did not inhibit c-Src activity .

Since mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on S473 , the phosphorylation of this site is often used as a reporter of mTORC2 activity .
Similarly , experiments using B82L cells expressing the EGFR Y5F mutant , which lacks the five major autophosphorylation sites ( Y992 , Y1068 , Y1086 , Y1148 , Y1173 ) but in which the tyrosine kinase activity is intact , also showed that the autophosphorylation sites on the EGFR are necessary for rapamycin- mediated increase in Erk1/2 and RSK phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ) .
Immuno-flourescence studies using anti-phospho- T573 antibody which recognizes phospho-forms of RSK1 , RSK2 , and RSK3 showed that in B82L cells rapamycin not only increased the phosphorylation of RSKs but also translocated the active RSKs into the nucleus ( XREF_FIG ) .

In addition , when Phos-A peptide was titrated in the phosphorylation assay performed side-by-side for Tau and beta-catenin ( without Axin but with CK1 priming phosphorylation ) , indistinguishable dose dependent inhibition of GSK3 by Phos-A was reproducibly observed ( XREF_FIG ) .
These results suggest that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif inhibits GSK3 kinase activity towards multiple substrates .

It has been well established that inhibition of GSK3 , such as via a dominant negative GSK3 mutant , activates Wnt and beta-catenin signaling and induces axis duplication in Xenopus embryos XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
These results led us to suspect that GSK3 is directly inhibited by the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide .
The dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide can activate beta-catenin signaling in Xenopus embryos .
Wnt may induce a Frizzled-LRP6 coreceptor complex XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , which in turn triggers the phosphorylation of LRP6 intracellular domain at five conserved PPP ( S/T ) PX ( S/T ) motifs ( referred to as PPPSPXS for simplicity ) XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
Importantly the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif represents a key and minimal functional module of the Wnt receptor complex , since it is sufficient to trigger beta-catenin signaling when transferred to a heterologous receptor XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
Given that a single PPPSPXS motif upon phosphorylation is sufficient to activate beta-catenin signaling in both mammalian cells and Xenopus embryos XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , we tested whether phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs from LRP6 had any effect on beta-catenin phosphorylation in this in vitro assay .
Wnt activates the beta-catenin pathway via two distinct classes of receptors on the cell surface : one is a member of the Frizzled family of seven-transmembrane receptors , and the other is a single transmembrane receptor referred to as LDL receptor related protein 6 ( LRP6 ) , or its relative LRP5 .
We note that our findings are fully compatible with specific inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation by Wnt signaling ( see below ) . ++++ This model provides a possible mechanism to account , in part , for inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation by Wnt activated LRP6 . ++++ This correlates with the fact that Wnt signaling primarily inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 but not Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ; ( iv ) finally we found that injection of a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide , but not the mutant PPPAPXA peptide , into Xenopus embryos is able to induce axis duplication and the expression of Xnr3 , a Wnt and beta-catenin target gene ( XREF_FIG ) , consistent with the notion that phosphorylated PPPSPXS inhibits GSK3 in vivo .

Although the Phos-A peptide inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 , it had no effect on beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1 ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Taking advantage of this property , we found that beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 in the absence of Axin was also inhibited by the Phos-A peptide in a dose dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ) .
The phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 but not by CK1 via an Axin independent manner . ++++ These results together suggest that the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif can inhibit beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 independent of Axin , but it does not affect beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser45 by CK1 .
However , while Cselenyi et al. suggested that LRP6 specifically inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin but not of other substrates XREF_BIBR , our data suggest that the phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide behaves as a general GSK3 inhibitor .
The dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide inhibits the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and Tau by GSK3 .
Since the dually phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide directly inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 independent of Axin , we tested whether this inhibition was specific for beta-catenin or was broad for other GSK3 substrates , such as glycogen synthase ( GS ) and the Tau protein XREF_BIBR .
The HA and A-mut peptides did not inhibit beta-catenin phosphorylation at all concentrations tested ( XREF_FIG ) .
We found that each of the multiple phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptides inhibits the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 in a sequence and phosphorylation dependent manner .
Indeed beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 was promoted by Axin ( 351-701 ) similarly to that by the wild type Axin , and importantly , was inhibited by Phos-A in a dose dependent manner regardless of the presence of Axin or Axin ( 351-701 ) ( XREF_FIG ) .
As the dually phosphorylated Phos-A peptide inhibits GSK3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin in vitro , we examined whether Phos-A could inhibit GSK3 and activate beta-catenin signaling in vivo .
Furthermore , when the amount of peptides used in the phosphorylation assay was titrated , Phos-A , Phos-C and Phos-E peptides inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner ( XREF_FIG ) , whereas Phos-D was significantly less active ( XREF_FIG ) .

Since Axin is a scaffolding protein critical for GSK3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin and binds to the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , we considered the possibility whether inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation by the phosphorylated PPPSPXP motif involves the binding between Axin and the phosphorylated PPPSPXS motif .
In the presence of Wnt ligands , the activation of the Wnt pathway results in inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33 and Ser37 ( and Thr41 ) by GSK3 , thereby preventing beta-catenin ubiquitination and degradation .
This result implies that Phos-A inhibition of beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 may not involve its binding to Axin .
The Phos-D peptide , which is atypical and has a CPPSPXS motif ( XREF_FIG ) , inhibited beta-catenin phosphorylation by GSK3 to a less degree ( XREF_FIG ) .
Therefore we have reconstituted an in vitro kinase assay for Axin dependent beta-catenin amino-terminal phosphorylation by CK1 and GSK3 using purified proteins . ++++ This may be analogous to parallel mechanisms that promote GSK3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin in the absence of Wnt stimulation , such as by GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylation of Axin and APC XREF_BIBR .

Likewise , the PI3K and AKT pathway is activated by IR via either direct or IRS mediated recruitment of PI3K , whereas EGFR mediated PI3K activation occurs mainly via a more intricate route that involves EGFR- and Src induced phosphorylation of the Grb2 associated binder 1 ( GAB1 ) . ++++ The lack of GAB1 phosphorylation by EGFR leads to phospho-ERK changes that are qualitatively similar to the changes induced by the lack of GAB1-PIP 3 binding ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , whereas the effects of IRS depletion are qualitatively similar to the effects of disruption of IRS-SHP2 interactions ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Although EGF was reported to induce phosphorylation of IRS proteins in A431 cells that express high levels of EGFR , EGF could not induce significant IRS phosphorylation in HEK293 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , which is consistent with other studies .
These results confirm the in silico prediction of the larger influence of GAB1 depletion on EGF- rather than on EGF plus insulin induced ERK phosphorylation .
First , IR binds and phosphorylates Shc with very low efficacy compared with EGFR ( and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , whereas in EGF signaling , the Shc dependent pathways contribute substantially to the Grb2-SOS membrane recruitment and subsequent Ras activation .
Phosphorylated IRS and GAB1 recruit cytoplasmic proteins PI3K , Grb2-SOS , SHP2 , and RasGAP to the plasma membrane , which results in additional PIP 3 production and both activatory and inhibitory regulations of Ras activity .
Downstream targets of EGFR and IR , such as ERK , GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) or mTOR ( the mammalian target of rapamycin ) , feedback and phosphorylate GAB1 and IRS on serine/threonine residues , which disable tyrosine phosphorylation at sites engaging PI3K , Grb2 , RasGAP or SHP2 .

Following initial PI3K stimulation and production of PIP 3 , IRS and GAB1 bind PIP 3 and get phosphorylated by IR or EGFR and Src .
As expected , 100 nM WT prevented AKT phosphorylation in response to insulin and EGF ( XREF_FIG ) .
At the same time , this gain in phospho-GAB1 also increases the amount of RasGAP ( Ras deactivator ) and the phosphatase SHP2 bound to GAB1 .

Second , IRS1-6 docking proteins , when phosphorylated by IR , bind preferably PI3K , whereas their binding to Grb2-SOS is weak .
Downstream targets of EGFR and IR , such as ERK , GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) or mTOR ( the mammalian target of rapamycin ) , feedback and phosphorylate GAB1 and IRS on serine/threonine residues , which disable tyrosine phosphorylation at sites engaging PI3K , Grb2 , RasGAP or SHP2 .
Phosphorylated IRS and GAB1 recruit cytoplasmic proteins PI3K , Grb2-SOS , SHP2 , and RasGAP to the plasma membrane , which results in additional PIP 3 production and both activatory and inhibitory regulations of Ras activity .
IR phosphorylates IRS proteins , which are linked to the activation of Ras and ERK pathway through binding to the Grb2 and SOS complex ( SOS is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras ) , whereas EGFR activates the same pathway either by direct binding of Grb2-SOS or by binding and phosphorylation of Shc , which then recruits the Grb2 and SOS complex .
Moreover , we found that RNAi mediated suppression of Src in HEK293 cells led to a decrease in GAB1 phosphorylation that was more pronounced for EGF than for insulin .
This potentiation of Ras and ERK response is initiated by insulin induced PIP 3 increase , which leads to subsequent increases in membrane recruitment of Grb2-SOS and SHP2 by GAB1 and IRS .
The data confirm that insulin-EGF co-stimulation increased the PI3K and GAB1 complex concentration at 30 s and 1.5 min , whereas the post-peak levels were decreased compared with EGF only stimulation , in agreement with in silico predictions ( XREF_FIG , right panel ) .
At the same time , this gain in phospho-GAB1 also increases the amount of RasGAP ( Ras deactivator ) and the phosphatase SHP2 bound to GAB1 .

By contrast , insulin treatment resulted in potent phosphorylation of IRS1 at Y612 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , which is one of the nine putative PI3K binding sites .
In the model , co-stimulation of cells by EGF and insulin increases the amount of PIP 3 produced by PI3K ( relative to EGF stimulation alone ) and further facilitates the GAB1 membrane recruitment and its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG , left and middle panels ) .
Likewise , the PI3K and AKT pathway is activated by IR via either direct or IRS mediated recruitment of PI3K , whereas EGFR mediated PI3K activation occurs mainly via a more intricate route that involves EGFR- and Src induced phosphorylation of the Grb2 associated binder 1 ( GAB1 ) .

GSK3 activates the hTERT promoter . ++++ Together these data confirm that GSK3 activates the cloned hTERT promoter in multiple cell lines .
To extend the observation that diverse GSK3 inhibitors suppress hTERT promoter activity , we performed hTERT reporter assays and parallel MTT assays , titrating the selective inhibitors AR-A014418 ( benzyl-thiazolyl urea substructure ) , TWS119 ( pyrollopyrimidine core ) , and 6-bromoindirubin-3 '-oxime ( BIO , indirubin core ) alongside the GSK3-inactive BIO derivative 1-methyl-BIO ( MeBIO ) XREF_BIBR .
Detectable immunoreactive epitopes of c-Myc , p65 and p53 were reduced 2.9-fold , 4-fold and 2-fold respectively , while that of STAT3 was increased 4.5-fold , confirming that GSK3 inhibition rapidly affects the hTERT promoter environment involving direct regulation by at least four factors suggested by network analysis .
To determine whether GSK3 inhibition suppresses endogenous telomerase , 5637 , HCT116 and A2780 cells were cultured continuously in log phase with BIO or DMSO given twice-weekly for five weeks .
Telomerase suppression by GSK3 inhibitors may partly involve Wnt pathways , but presumably also involves other GSK3 activities .

Similarly , BIO , but not MeBIO activated Topflash reporter activity in all cells , indicative of specific GSK3beta inhibition ( supporting XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Roscovitine also mildly induced cyclin D1 ( 2.7-fold ) but , in contrast with BIO , decreased beta-catenin ( 49 % of control ) and cyclin E2 ( 34 % ) .
To further investigate the network structure , we determined the presence of the MYC , RELA , and ESR1 gene promoters in the p53 ChIP experiments from XREF_FIG in which p53 binding to the hTERT promoter was decreased .
BIO inhibits hTERT expression and tumour growth in xenografts . ++++ RT-QPCR analysis confirmed that BIO suppressed hTERT expression in all three cell lines ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Most importantly , BIO suppressed hTERT expression and telomerase activity with resultant telomere shortening over five weeks treatment in three cancer cell lines , indicating that a promoter screening approach can identify bona fide telomerase inhibitors .

Taking into consideration that JNK activity is not completely inhibited by SP600125 , the role of JNK in the SG assembly may be underestimated .
WDR62 activates JNK and can serve as JNK substrate . ++++ To examine whether or not WDR62 mediates this form of JNK activation toward AP-1 transcription , we measured AP-1-dependent transcription by using a luciferase reporter plasmid placed under the control of four tandem repeats of SV40 AP-1-binding elements ( 4 X AP-1-luciferase ) . ++++ WDR62 Potentiates JNK Activity . ++++ Thus , although WDR62 is able to activate JNK kinase activity , JNK activation does not result in the classical signaling pathway leading to c-Jun phosphorylation and the corresponding increase in AP-1-dependent transcription .
MAPKs are activated through a protein kinase cascade in which a MAP 3K activates a MAP 2K that in turn activates a MAPK .

WDR62 may mediate mRNA fate following stress .
To examine whether a persistent activation state of JNK may affect WDR62-JNK association , we used cotransfection of Myc-JBP5 encoding plasmid either alone or with one of the three after JNK1 expression plasmids encoding HA-JNKK2-JNK1 ( JNK is activated persistently by its upstream MAP2K ) , HA-JNK1 APF ( JNK1 mutant in its TGY-dual phosphorylation site and thus can not be activated by the upstream kinase MKK4/7 ) , and HA-JNK1 ( wild type JNK1 ) .

CPT induces double stranded DNA breaks and activates ATM , which acts upstream in the activation of the Chk1 and Chk2 pathway .
While CPT has been used throughout this study to induce DNA damage , use of other chemotherapeutic agents such as nutlin , cisplatin , actinomycin D or ionizing radiations might provide detailed insight into the need of phosphorylation for efficient 14-3-3 interaction at the molecular level .

gamma and epsilon isoforms but not tau and sigma enhance specific-DNA binding of p53 in vitro .
In addition , p53beta isoform hetero-tetramerize with wild-type p53 and stimulates it for bax expression but not p21 .
Hence , if p53 TAD anchors additional binding sites for sigma and tau that are created upon DNA damage , it is possible that binding of sigma and tau to p53 TAD could competitively inhibit the binding of MDM2 to p53 TAD , resulting in increased p53 levels , similar to competitive binding of p300 and MDM2 to p53 TAD .

Together , these results demonstrate that RUNX3 is a direct target of Src . ++++ Although we have evidence that RUNX3 is a target of Src ( XREF_FIG ) , our results do not rule out the possibility that another tyrosine kinase , activated by Src , could also phosphorylate RUNX3 .
The nuclear re-localization of endogenous RUNX3 was also observed after MKN45 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B for 4 h ( XREF_FIG C ) .
Although it is generally difficult to restore the function of a lost tumor suppressor gene , it might be feasible to pharmacologically restore the function of the mislocalized RUNX3 , because RUNX3 can be relocalized in the nucleus by an Src inhibitor .
RUNX3 also suppresses the development of colon cancer by forming a ternary complex with beta-catenin-TCF4 and attenuating Wnt mediated signaling activity .
Src mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 was dramatically decreased by treatment with a protein phosphatase ( lambda-phosphatase ) in the cell lysates ( XREF_FIG D ) .
In vitro kinase assays performed with GST-Src and His RUNX3 proteins showed tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 by Src in an Src concentration dependent manner ( XREF_FIG F ) . ++++ Collectively , our results demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 by activated Src is associated with the cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3 in gastric and breast cancers . ++++ To determine whether the shifted RUNX3 band found in lysates from the cancer cell lines might represent tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 by Src kinase , we analyzed cell lysates after the siRNA mediated knockdown of Src or the overexpression of Src . ++++ Collectively , our results demonstrate that RUNX3 is a target of the Src kinase and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 by Src is associated with the cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3 .
In this study , we provide evidence that Src phosphorylates RUNX3 at multiple tyrosine residues . ++++ 2 ) Src phosphorylates RUNX3 at multiple tyrosine residues , both in vitro and in vivo . ++++ The experimental results presented thus far have shown the following : 1 ) Src overexpression induces alteration of subcellular localization of RUNX3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm ; and 2 ) Src phosphorylates RUNX3 at the tyrosine residues .
Because the tyrosine kinase activity of Src was required for the cytoplasmic localization of RUNX3 , we examined whether RUNX3 is phosphorylated by Src . ++++ Taken together , our results suggest that the shifted ( 58 kDa ) band represents endogenous RUNX3 that has been phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues by Src kinase . ++++ In conclusion , we found that Src phosphorylates RUNX3 and localizes the protein in the cytoplasm of gastric and breast cancer cells .

The results revealed that Fyn and Lck also interact with and phosphorylate RUNX3 as shown by the coimmunoprecipitation and the induced band shift of RUNX3 ( XREF_FIG D ) , suggesting that RUNX3 could be a target of other tyrosine kinases .
It phosphorylates p27 Kip1 on tyrosine residues and accelerates p27 Kip1 proteolysis .
The tyrosine phosphorylation of RUNX3 requires the catalytic activity of the Src kinase , because the kinase-dead Src mutant failed to phosphorylate RUNX3 ( XREF_FIG C ) .
These results demonstrate that Src not only phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues on RUNX3 but also interacts with the tyrosine phosphorylated RUNX3 .
The results revealed that Fyn and Lck also interact with and phosphorylate RUNX3 as shown by the coimmunoprecipitation and the induced band shift of RUNX3 ( XREF_FIG D ) , suggesting that RUNX3 could be a target of other tyrosine kinases .

Consistent with our previous findings XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , rapamycin inhibited the basal or IGF-1-stimulated cell motility by 60-70 % in Rh1 cells ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits cell motility , in part by targeting PP2A-Erk1/2 pathway . ++++ Expression of dominant negative PP2A confers resistance to rapamycin inhibition of cell motility . ++++ Since PP2A , a negative regulator of cell motility XREF_BIBR , has been implicated as a novel downstream target of mTOR XREF_BIBR , we determined whether rapamycin inhibits cell motility by activating PP2A . ++++ The results suggest that rapamycin inhibits cell motility , in part by targeting PP2A-Erk1/2 pathway . ++++ We found that downregulation of PP4 or PP6 neither altered the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility , nor affected rapamycin inhibition of the cell motility in Rh1 and Rh30 cells . ++++ However , downregulation of PP5 reduced the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by ~ 50 % , and slightly enhanced rapamycin inhibition of cell motility in Rh1 or Rh30 cells . ++++ Furthermore , expression of constitutively active MKK1 resulted in robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and also attenuated rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1-stimulated cell motility .
IGF-1 stimulation of mTOR represses PP2A , resulting in activation of Erk1/2 and this is prevented by rapamycin . ++++ IGF-1 stimulated the cell motility by ~ 3-fold , and this was dramatically attenuated by rapamycin to the basal level ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ In summary , here we have shown that rapamycin inhibits IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by activating PP2A and concurrently inhibiting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 . ++++ Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PP2A attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as cell motility , whereas expression of constitutively active MKK1 results in robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and confers resistance to rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1 stimulated cell motility . ++++ To determine whether a similar mechanism could explain rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1 activation of Erk1/2 , we used okadaic acid ( OA ) , a relatively specific PP2A inhibitor XREF_BIBR . ++++ Of interest , expression of dn-PP2A did not significantly affect the basal cell motility , but conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility ( XREF_FIG ) .
Because PP2A is negatively regulated by mTOR , we hypothesized that mTOR may regulate cell motility in part through PP2A-Erk1/2 pathway . ++++ IGF-1 stimulation of mTOR represses PP2A , resulting in activation of Erk1/2 and this is prevented by rapamycin . ++++ It has been described that insulin or IGF-1 stimulates activation of S6K1 , which is attributed to mTOR repression of PP2A activity against S6K1 XREF_BIBR . ++++ Our results support the notion that PP2A lies downstream of mTOR and is negatively regulated by mTOR .
Instead , both IGF-1 and EGF caused dissociation of PP2Ac from Erk1/2 , which was partially prevented by rapamycin XREF_BIBR . ++++ The data imply that PD98059 and rapamycin may redundantly inhibit Erk1/2 . ++++ PD98059 inhibits Erk1/2 by directly inhibiting MEK1/2 , whereas rapamycin inactivates Erk1/2 by direct inhibition of mTOR , causing activation of PP2A .
Furthermore , inhibition of PP2A with okadaic acid significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as cell motility . ++++ Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PP2A attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as cell motility , whereas expression of constitutively active MKK1 results in robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and confers resistance to rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1 stimulated cell motility .
PP2A negatively regulates Erk1/2 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , though this notion is controversial XREF_BIBR . ++++ Since Erk1/2 , negatively regulated by PP2A XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , have been implicated in the regulation of cell motility XREF_BIBR , we next investigated whether the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell motility is through downregulation of Erk1/2 .
Furthermore , we found that IGF-1 decreased the activity of PP2A , which was prevented by rapamycin ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ IGF-1 stimulation of mTOR represses PP2A , resulting in activation of Erk1/2 and this is prevented by rapamycin .
For instance , rapamycin inhibits differentiation of C2C12 cells , which is independent of mTOR kinase activity XREF_BIBR , despite of existence of disputation XREF_BIBR .
Inhibition of PP2A activity promotes motility in a number of transformed cells and cancer cell lines XREF_BIBR , whereas activation of PP2A by beta 2 -adrenergic receptor agonists inhibits motility of keratinocytes XREF_BIBR .
Of interest , expression of dn-PP2A did not significantly affect the basal cell motility , but conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , downregulation of PP5 reduced the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by ~ 50 % , and slightly enhanced rapamycin inhibition of cell motility in Rh1 or Rh30 cells .
Also , due to failure to activate PP2A in the cells expressing dn-PP2A ( XREF_FIG ) , rapamycin did not obviously inhibit IGF-1-induced phospho-Erk1/2 in Rh1 and dn-PP 2A cells either ( data not shown ) .
Because okadaic acid selectively inhibits PP2A without inhibiting PP1 in intact cells at concentrations up to 100 nM XREF_BIBR , serum starved Rh1 cells were treated with rapamycin ( 100 ng/ml ) in the presence of OA ( 100 nM ) .
They share same mechanism and specifically block the function of mTOR , inhibiting growth of numerous solid tumors ( renal , breast , prostate , colon and brain cancers ) with only mild side effects XREF_BIBR .
Here we show that rapamycin inhibited the basal or insulin like growth factor 1 ( IGF-1 )-induced motility of human Ewing sarcoma ( Rh1 ) and rhabdomyosarcoma ( Rh30 ) cells .
For instance , rapamycin has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation by decreasing PP2A activity through dissociation alpha4 from the PP2Ac XREF_BIBR .
In summary , here we have shown that rapamycin inhibits IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by activating PP2A and concurrently inhibiting phosphorylation of Erk1/2 . ++++ IGF-1 stimulated the cell motility by ~ 3-fold , and this was dramatically attenuated by rapamycin to the basal level ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PP2A attenuated the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on IGF-1-stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 as well as cell motility , whereas expression of constitutively active MKK1 results in robust phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and confers resistance to rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1 stimulated cell motility . ++++ However , downregulation of PP5 reduced the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by ~ 50 % , and slightly enhanced rapamycin inhibition of cell motility in Rh1 or Rh30 cells . ++++ OA alone did not affect the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility significantly , but conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of the basal or IGF-1-stimulated cell motility in Rh1 cells ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Expression of MKK1-R4F slightly reduced the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility , but conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of the basal or IGF-1-induced cell motility ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ In contrast , expression of MKK1-K97M in the cells significantly inhibited the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ We found that downregulation of PP4 or PP6 neither altered the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility , nor affected rapamycin inhibition of the cell motility in Rh1 and Rh30 cells .
Here we demonstrated that rapamycin failed to activate PP2A in the cells expressing rapamycin resistant mTOR ( mTORrr ) , but not in control cells expressing the empty vector ( pcDNA3 ) ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that rapamycin activation of PP2A is indeed through inhibiting mTOR activity . ++++ Here we show that treatment with rapamycin activated PP2A and concurrently suppressed IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in human Ewing sarcoma ( Rh1 ) and rhabdomyosarcoma ( Rh30 ) cells . ++++ The rapamycin induced activation of PP2A was sustained for at least 24 h ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Similar data were observed in Rh1 and mTORrr cells ( data not shown ) , indicating that rapamycin induced activation of PP2A is mTOR dependent . ++++ For instance , rapamycin has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation by decreasing PP2A activity through dissociation alpha4 from the PP2Ac XREF_BIBR . ++++ To understand whether rapamycin activates PP2A through inhibition of mTOR , Rh1 and Rh30 cells stably expressing a rapamycin resistant mutant mTOR ( S2035I ) , mTORrr , that prevents binding of FKBP-rapamycin but has intact kinase activity , were used . ++++ This promoted us to determine whether rapamycin activation of PP2A is through inhibition of mTOR kinase activity . ++++ Treatment of the cells with rapamycin activated PP2A activity , and concurrently inhibited IGF-1 stimulated phosphorylation of Erk1/2 .
Since PP2A , a negative regulator of Erk1/2 and cell motility XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , has been implicated as a novel downstream target of mTOR XREF_BIBR , this study was set out to determine the role of PP2A-Erk1/2 pathway in mTOR mediated cell motility . ++++ To further define the role of Erk1/2 in mTOR mediated cell motility , we generated recombinant adenoviruses Ad-MKK1-R4F and Ad-MKK1-K97M , encoding FLAG tagged constitutively active and dominant negative MKK1 , respectively . ++++ It appears that mTOR mediated cell motility requires a coordination of multiple signaling molecules , at least including Erk1/2 , S6K1 and 4E-BP1 . ++++ Next , we investigated the role of PP2A in mTOR mediated cell motility . ++++ Little is known about the role of PP2A in the mTOR mediated cell motility . ++++ In the studies , we also assessed the roles of other PP2A family members , such as PP4 , PP6 and PP5 , in mTOR mediated cell motility , since these Ser/Thr protein phosphatses have been reported as novel downstream molecules of mTOR as well XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
To address whether activation of Erk1/2 by IGF-1 is responsible for increased cell motility , cells were exposed to PD98059 ( a selective inhibitor of MKK1/2 , upstream of Erk1/2 ) alone , or in combination with rapamycin . ++++ However , IGF-1 induced robust activation of Erk1/2 , as detected by Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes phospho-Erk1/2 ( Thr202 and Tyr204 ) . ++++ To determine whether a similar mechanism could explain rapamycin inhibition of IGF-1 activation of Erk1/2 , we used okadaic acid ( OA ) , a relatively specific PP2A inhibitor XREF_BIBR . ++++ It has been described that IGF-1 activates Erk1/2 by dissociating from Shc from PP2Ac XREF_BIBR . ++++ Activation of Erk1/2 by IGF-1 is associated with mitogenesis and cell motility XREF_BIBR .

However , downregulation of PP5 reduced the basal or IGF-1 stimulated cell motility by ~ 50 % , and slightly enhanced rapamycin inhibition of cell motility in Rh1 or Rh30 cells .
To understand whether rapamycin activates PP2A through inhibition of mTOR , Rh1 and Rh30 cells stably expressing a rapamycin resistant mutant mTOR ( S2035I ) , mTORrr , that prevents binding of FKBP-rapamycin but has intact kinase activity , were used .
Instead , both IGF-1 and EGF caused dissociation of PP2Ac from Erk1/2 , which was partially prevented by rapamycin XREF_BIBR .
Inhibition of Erk1/2 with PD98059 did not significantly affect the basal mobility of the cells , but dramatically inhibited IGF-1-induced cell motility .

When administered at cell-and tissue-relevant levels , IGF-1 stimulated both Erk1/2 and Akt activation , elevated cellular cyclin D1 content , and induced neoplastic proliferation .
While MOCM modestly increases Erk1/2 and Akt activity , long-term MEK and PI3K inhibition strikingly stimulates both kinases in an additive manner with conditioned media treatment .
Kras mediated activation of extracellular regulated kinase kinase ( MEK ) and phosphoinositide-3 kinase ( PI3K ) directly increases proliferation and cell survival through transcriptional regulation , increased cell cycle progression , and inhibition of pro apoptotic factors [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Combined MEK and PI3K inhibition blocks IGF-1 and MOCM induced neoplastic proliferation by decreasing cyclin D1 expression .
This study focused on the migration resulting from the increased CXCL1 ( KC ) and IL-18 observed under co-culture conditions , and did not determine if exogenous KC or IL-18 stimulated neoplastic proliferation .
To determine if MOCM and/or IGF-1 were similarly blocked by MEK and PI3K inhibition , LM2 and JF32 cells were treated with combinations of MEK and/or PI3K inhibitors , in the presence of IGF-1 or MOCM .
The ability of macrophage conditioned media to stimulate neoplastic proliferation correlated with media IGF-1 levels , and recombinant IGF-1 alone was sufficient to induce epithelial proliferation in all cell lines evaluated .
LM2 growth was equally stimulated by both naive and tumor educated BAL macrophages , while the growth of JF32 cells was enhanced slightly upon co-culture with tumor educated BAL macrophages .
Unlike IGF-1R , EGFR can be stimulated by numerous EGF like factors , which macrophages produce in a tissue and disease specific manner [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Sole inhibition of either MEK or PI3K partially limits macrophage stimulation of LM2 and JF32 growth to slightly different extents .
First , both MH-S and primary naive BAL macrophages stimulate neoplastic proliferation , but KC was undetectable in media conditioned by MH-S macrophages [ XREF_BIBR ] or primary BAL macrophages isolated from naive or lung-tumor bearing animals ( data not shown ) .
Such macrophage co-culture stimulated Erk1/2 and Akt activation , increased cyclin D1 expression , and enhanced the proliferation of neoplastic lung cells ; the inhibition of both MEK and PI3K could block this macrophage augmented tumor cell growth .
MEK inhibition raised p-Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 levels at 24 and 48 hrs , while PI3K inhibition caused a compensatory increase in cellular p-Akt levels from 24-48 hrs . ++++ MEK inhibition raised p-Erk1/2 and total Erk1/2 levels at 24 and 48 hrs , while PI3K inhibition caused a compensatory increase in cellular p-Akt levels from 24-48 hrs .
PI3K inhibition stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation from 4-24 hrs , and increased Akt phosphorylation throughout the treatment time-course .
PI3K inhibition stimulated Erk1/2 phosphorylation from 4-24 hrs , and increased Akt phosphorylation throughout the treatment time-course .
Conversely , PI3K inhibition ( by LY294002 ) increased basal p-Erk1/2 levels at the expense of p-Akt ( 4 hrs time point ; Figure XREF_FIG ) .
One alpha-IGF siRNA construct was more effective than the scr siRNA , and significantly decreased MOCM IGF-1 levels to 25 % of control .
Akt phosphorylates cRaf at S259 , which creates a binding domain for 14-3-3 protein family members [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Cytosolic Raf functionally links the Erk and Akt pathways ; activated Akt can phosphorylate cRaf at S259 , placing Erk regulation downstream of Akt activation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Thus , active Akt could phosphorylate and inactivate cRaf , leading to decreased Erk1/2 signaling , but cells with mutant Kras can bypass this regulatory mechanism and maintain high cRaf activity [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
We show herein that MOCM stimulated neoplastic proliferation significantly increases cyclin D1 expression , which is abrogated by the combined inhibition of both MEK and PI3K .
In LM2 cells , MEK inhibition ( by U0126 ) suppressed early Erk1/2 phosphorylation while p-Akt levels increased .

However , we demonstrate that the cell line specific existence of the BRAF mutation and the ability of SB202190 to inhibit the ERK1/2 pathway do not correlate with the cell line specific vacuolization induced by SB202190 indicating that other pathways , such as PI3K/PKB/Akt , are responsible for the effects observed .
However , several studies from different genetic models have shown a role for p38 MAPK in the regulation of autophagy XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR and a recent study has proposed that p38 MAPK alpha inhibits autophagy by interfering with the intracellular trafficking of Atg9 XREF_BIBR .
Although the SB compounds were thought to specifically inhibit the alpha and beta isoforms of p38 MAPK leading to suppression of inflammatory gene expression , later studies identified several further protein kinase targets of these compounds including GAK , GSK3beta , RICK ( RIP2 ) , Casein kinase I , Type-II TGF receptor , LCK , CRAF ( Raf-1 ) , BRAF and PDK1 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .

In addition nutrient starvation induced autophagic proteolysis was also significantly suppressed by SB202190 treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
SB203580 was previously shown to inhibit BRAF and CRAF in vitro ( 31 ) .
Furthermore , inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB202190 was demonstrated to induce transcriptional reprogramming which involves a shift from HIF-1alpha-dependent to Foxo-3A-dependent pro autophagic gene expression leading to type-II programmed cell death XREF_BIBR .

SB202190 , a widely used inhibitor of p38 MAPKalpha and beta , was recently described to induce autophagic vacuoles and cell death in colon and ovarian cancer cells lines and , therefore , this effect was supposed to be specific for transformed cells and to open therapeutic options . ++++ SB202190 was shown to induce autophagic vacuoles and cell death in a colon-cancer specific manner XREF_BIBR .
Rapamycin induces active autophagic proteolysis sensitive to leupeptin treatment , while SB202190 induces non productive autophagy , accumulation of p62 and LC3-II . ++++ SB202190 treatment leads to non productive autophagy and accumulation of autophagic substrates .
siRNA mediated down-regulation of GAK , GSK3beta , RIP2 and RIP3 also did not induce formation of vacuoles ( data not shown ) .
Since the PDK1 inhibitor BX912 does not induce vacuolization , only a direct effect of SB202190 on PI3K in a cell type specific manner could explain the early effects observed .
Vacuole formation in SB202190- and SB203580 treated cells correlated with the late stage up regulation of LC3-II , which is not up-regulated in response to BIRB-796 and VX-745 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Interestingly , SB202190 induced FHRE-luc reporter activity was observed only after 48 h of SB202190 treatment ( XREF_FIG ) .
Furthermore , we analyzed whether SB202190 induced JNK activation in HT29 cells is required for SB202190 induced vacuolization .
However , regardless to the interesting ability of SB202190 to target the ERK pathway in these cells , this property does not correlate with vacuolization ( cf. XREF_TABLE ) .
Vacuole formation in SB202190- and SB203580 treated cells correlated with the late stage up regulation of LC3-II , which is not up-regulated in response to BIRB-796 and VX-745 ( XREF_FIG ) .

As determined by Western blotting of extracts , a significant increase in p53 acetylation in response to the etoposide induced DNA damage was observed over 60 min time period ( XREF_FIG , Acp53 ) . ++++ In agreement with these in vitro results , when human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were treated with etoposide , H1 .2 phosphorylation at T146 was rapidly increased within 15 min following etoposide induced DNA damage and decreased to the base line after 60 min of etoposide treatment ( XREF_FIG , DMSO , pT146 ) .
In this study , we also establish another modification pathway in which DNA-PK attenuates the repressive action of H1 .2 against p53 mediated transactivation .
For instance , mouse histone H1b is recruited to the MyoD promoter by Msx1 homeoprotein and enhances Msx1 activity in delaying the differentiation of progenitor cells into muscle .
When H1 .2 was pre-modified by DNA-PK , the H1 .2 core complex lost its ability to repress p53 dependent , p300 mediated transcription from nucleosome arrays ( XREF_FIG , lane 4 versus lane 5 ) .
Although our studies uncovered a previously unrecognized role for the H1 .2 complex in suppressing p53 transcriptional activity , it was not clear how H1 .2 dissociates from p53 to initiate p53 transactivation in response to DNA damage .
In agreement with these in vitro results , when human osteosarcoma U2OS cells were treated with etoposide , H1 .2 phosphorylation at T146 was rapidly increased within 15 min following etoposide induced DNA damage and decreased to the base line after 60 min of etoposide treatment ( XREF_FIG , DMSO , pT146 ) .

However , expression of the H1 .2 core complex containing wild type or phosphorylation mimicking mutant ( T146E ) H1 .2 could not induce apoptotic cell death ( assays 4 and 5 ) .
However , we speculate that mitosis coupled phosphorylation of H1 .2 does not require DNA-PK and may be mediated by cell cycle regulated kinases , such as cyclin dependent kinases .
However , in our binding experiments , H1 .2 phosphorylation did not impede H1 .2 interaction with PURalpha and YB1 ( data not shown ) , suggesting that H1 .2 phosphorylation acts without affecting the stability of the H1 .2 core complex .

Dasatinib ( BMS-354825 ) , a dual specific SRC and BCR-ABL inhibitor that is currently tested in clinical trials , has been shown to significantly reduce migration and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro at concentrations when no major effect on melanoma cell proliferation or survival was observed .

Most importantly , MEK inhibition resulted in an increase in MMP-2 expression , indicating that in melanoma cells MEK and ERK signalling suppresses the MMP-2 promoter .
We have discovered that in melanoma cells MEK inhibition by selumetinib ( AZD6244 , ARRY-142886 ) or PD184352 while efficiently suppressing proliferation stimulates increased invasiveness .
Furthermore the ATF/CREB transcription factor ATF3 can suppress the MMP-2 promoter , and the expression by ATF3 is regulated by ERK .
Crucially however , when MEK is inhibited in melanoma cells while already grown in a 3D matrix , this does not reduce their invasion .

Selumetinib efficiently suppressed WM266-4 cell growth , and at a concentration of 1muM also induced cell death over a period of 72 hours .
This finding was surprising , because it is generally accepted that ERK and MAP-kinase signalling is required for growth factor receptor induced 2D cell migration .
Instead , in MEK inhibited cells phospho-MLC was restricted to the retracting end of the cell ( XREF_FIG ) , which is indicative for the ' mesenchymal ' mode of invasion , where Rho and ROCK activities are high in the rear of the cells and Rac driven actin assembly occurs at the leading edge .
The suppression of proteolytic activities completely abolished the MEK inhibitor induced invasiveness ( XREF_FIG ) , clearly demonstrating that MEK inhibition in melanoma cells promotes a protease dependent ' mesenchymal ' mode of invasion .
Dasatinib ( BMS-354825 ) , a dual specific SRC and BCR-ABL inhibitor that is currently tested in clinical trials , has been shown to significantly reduce migration and invasion of melanoma cells in vitro at concentrations when no major effect on melanoma cell proliferation or survival was observed .
Importantly , reduced Rho activity at the membrane regulates the early stages of cell spreading , where it leads to increased substrate adhesion .
We have discovered that although MEK inhibition in BRAF mutant melanoma cells produces a very potent block in proliferation , it also increases the invasive behaviour of these cells into 3D fibrillar collagen .
For cells to invade with this shape they need to modulate the ECM through protease activities , such as matrix-metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) .
A potent orally active MEK inhibitor that blocks ERK activation in cells at a concentration of 10-100nM is selumetinib ( AZD6244 , ARRY-142886 ) .
In over 40 % of cases this is due to activating mutations in the serine threonine kinase BRAF , and in a further 20 % this is caused by mutations in NRAS .
All together MEK inhibition in melanoma cells induces a ' mesenchymal ' phenotype that is characterised by protease driven invasion .
Furthermore , pre-treatment of melanoma cells for 24h on plastic , thus affecting ERK mediated transcriptional events before exposure to a 3D matrix , results in suppression of invasion .
Thus , although the MAP kinase pathway often activates MMP genes , we have shown that it also can suppress MMP expression most probably depending on the cell type and the signalling context .
Because saractinib suppressed adhesion in the presence of MEK inhibitor ( see XREF_FIG ) , we assessed its effect on invasion under these conditions .

Combination of MEK and SRC inhibition suppresses melanoma cell growth and invasion .

However , dose limiting side effects are observed , and MEK inhibitors that sufficiently reduce ERK activation in patients show a low clinical response .
Combination of MEK and SRC inhibition suppresses melanoma cell growth and invasion .
At the cellular level the Rho and ROCK mediated mode of invasion is represented by a round cell-shape that shows reduced ECM adhesion , whereas the MMP and protease mediated mode of invasion is linked to a more elongated ' mesenchymal ' morphology and is dependent on integrin mediated ECM adhesion .
Combination of MEK and SRC inhibition suppresses melanoma cell growth and invasion .
This mode of invasion is dependent on integrin mediated adhesion , and because SRC kinases are main regulators of this process , the SRC kinase inhibitor saracatinib ( AZD0530 ) completely abolished the MEK inhibitor induced invasion .
Inhibition of MEK suppresses actin-cortex contraction and increases integrin mediated adhesion .
Thus , although the MAP kinase pathway often activates MMP genes , we have shown that it also can suppress MMP expression most probably depending on the cell type and the signalling context .
Besides MMP-2 we found that MEK also suppressed MT1-MMP expression .
This mode of invasion is dependent on integrin mediated adhesion , and because SRC kinases are main regulators of this process , the SRC kinase inhibitor saracatinib ( AZD0530 ) completely abolished the MEK inhibitor induced invasion .
This mode of invasion is dependent on integrin mediated adhesion , and because SRC kinases are main regulators of this process , the SRC kinase inhibitor saracatinib ( AZD0530 ) completely abolished the MEK inhibitor induced invasion .
In summary , MEK inhibition of melanoma cells in fibrillar collagen produces all characteristics of a ' mesenchymal ' invasion phenotype with an elongated morphology based on reduced Rho mediated MLC phosphorylation , enhanced integrin mediated adhesion and increased expression of MMPs .
We found that inhibition of MEK in the context of a 3D matrix resulted in the induction of an elongated cell shape and increased integrin mediated adhesion .
The cell shape of this so called ' mesenchymal ' phenotype is based on the loss of actin-myosin contraction within the cell cortex , which is due to reduced MLC phosphorylation downstream of Rho and ROCK signalling at the membrane .

Importantly , although selumetinib increased integrin mediated adhesion , it did not increase the amount of activated SRC kinase detectable as auto-phosphorylation activity at Y416 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Selumetinib enhances beta1-integrin mediated adhesion to collagen .
For instance , ERK can directly phosphorylate and activate the m-isoform of the calcium dependent protease calpain ( calpain2 ) , and this is crucial for the proteolysis and turnover of several adhesion components including focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) .
It is generally accepted that the ERK and MAP kinase pathway regulates MMP expression in cancer cells , although in melanoma only few reports document such a regulation , in particular of MMP-1 or MMP-13 .
Most importantly inhibition of MEK by either selumetinib or PD184352 did not reduce the amount of pro- and active MMP-2 .
It is commonly accepted that ERK and MAP kinase signalling activates the expression of various MMP genes such as MMP-9 , MMP-1 or MMP-13 .

In fact , levels of phospho-4EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 are strongly reduced by selenite treatment in whole-cell extracts , further suggesting that selenite inhibits mTOR activity in these cells ( XREF_FIG A , lower panel ) . ++++ We also observed selenite specific loss of phospho-ribosomal S6 protein ; considering the increased eIF4E-4EBP1 interaction and apparent dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 ( XREF_FIG A ) , it seems likely that mTOR activity is down-regulated by selenite , a possible consequence of selenite induced ROS ( XREF_FIG B ) .
Thus , although arsenite is a known inducer of oxidative stress , the species of intracellular ROS generated by arsenite and selenite treatment appear to be different ; both trigger the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha , but only the latter diminishes the phosphorylaton of 4EBP1 and S6 , possibly by down-regulation of mTOR .

Aside from the inhibition of apoptosis by sequestration of signaling molecules as described above , SGs assembled in hypoxic tumor cells have been shown to inhibit the translation of angiogenic factors and promote resistance to radiotherapy .
These results raise the possibility that selenite induced SGs may be impaired in their ability to increase cellular resistance to stress .
We found that selenite potently inhibits translation and induces the ROS dependent assembly of SGs that lack the pro survival proteins found in typical SGs .

As shown in XREF_FIG , depletion of 4EBP1 significantly enhanced the viability of selenite treated cells ( right panel ) .
It is also possible , however , that depletion of 4EBP1 promotes cell survival by a mechanism that is unrelated to SG assembly .
It will be of great interest to determine whether SGs induced by amino acid starvation are Type 2 SGs , and whether selenite induced SGs are selectively enriched in 5 ' TOP mRNAs .
Unlike EGP-bodies , however , eIF4A is modestly accumulated in selenite induced SGs , and O-GlcNAc-modified proteins , which are lacking in S. cerevisiae , are found in selenite induced SGs , indicating that selenite induced SGs are not an exact counterpart of yeast EGP-bodies . ++++ Unlike EGP-bodies , however , eIF4A is modestly accumulated in selenite induced SGs , and O-GlcNAc-modified proteins , which are lacking in S. cerevisiae , are found in selenite induced SGs , indicating that selenite induced SGs are not an exact counterpart of yeast EGP-bodies . ++++ We found that selenite potently inhibits translation and induces the ROS dependent assembly of SGs that lack the pro survival proteins found in typical SGs . ++++ Type 2 SGs , induced by selenite , lack eIF3 subunits and several other critical Type 1 SG components , rely primarily on 4EBP for assembly and inhibit cellular survival during stress . ++++ It will be of great interest to determine whether SGs induced by amino acid starvation are Type 2 SGs , and whether selenite induced SGs are selectively enriched in 5 ' TOP mRNAs . ++++ An important observation regarding selenite induced SGs is their lack of accumulation of several canonical SG components . ++++ Most of the canonical SG components are efficiently recruited to selenite induced SGs , including Ago2 , FMR1 , HuR and PCBP2 ( XREF_FIG A ) . ++++ Consistent with this hypothesis , cells that are depleted of 4EBP1 and thus compromised in the ability to assemble selenite induced SGs exhibited higher cell viability in response to selenite stress ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ The lack of eIF3b localization in selenite induced SGs was also observed with the human prostate cancer cell line DU145 , confirming that this is not a phenomenon specific to U2OS cells . ++++ Unlike EGP-bodies , however , eIF4A is modestly accumulated in selenite induced SGs , and O-GlcNAc-modified proteins , which are lacking in S. cerevisiae , are found in selenite induced SGs , indicating that selenite induced SGs are not an exact counterpart of yeast EGP-bodies . ++++ Although selenite induced SGs are observed in both WT and S51A MEFs , the SGs assembled in S51A MEFs are smaller than those observed in WT MEFs ( XREF_FIG C ) . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG , PABP ( poly-A binding protein ) , eIF4G , eIF4E and eIF4A are recruited to both arsenite- and selenite induced SGs . ++++ Collectively , these results reveal that selenite induces bona fide SGs in which TIAR , G3BP and poly-( A ) mRNAs are selectively concentrated . ++++ The lack of eIF3b suggests that the selenite induced SGs are different from not only arsenite induced SGs but also SGs triggered by many other stimuli in mammalian cells . ++++ In contrast , eIF3b , a protein that is one of the most reliable markers of mammalian SGs and is recruited to SGs under various stresses , is selectively excluded from selenite induced SGs ( XREF_FIG , bottom panel ; compare with Supplementary Figure S2A ) . ++++ We noticed that selenite induced SGs are generally smaller and found closer to the cell periphery than arsenite induced SGs . ++++ In addition , although eIF2alpha phosphorylation is not an absolute requirement , it appears to contribute to the proper assembly of selenite induced SGs ( XREF_FIG C ) . ++++ Another interesting aspect of selenite induced SGs is that their biogenesis appears to involve 4EBP , which has not previously been implicated in SG assembly . ++++ Among SG components that are not explicitly involved in RNA metabolism , Rsk2 is recruited to selenite induced SGs , possibly through its interaction with TIA-1 . ++++ O-GlcNAc-modified proteins were also found in selenite induced SGs . ++++ Selenite induced SGs differ from canonical mammalian SGs in their morphology , composition and mechanism of assembly . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG A , co-staining with the P-body marker Hedls/Ge -1 revealed that selenite induced SGs are often found in close physical apposition to P-bodies . ++++ In contrast , RACK1 , importin alpha1 and beta1 and HDAC6 , which are known components of arsenite induced SGs , are excluded from selenite induced SGs , at least in U2OS cells ( XREF_FIG C , compare with Supplementary Figure S2 ) . ++++ Selenite induced SGs lack several classical SG components , including proteins that contribute to pro survival functions of canonical SGs . ++++ Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that 4EBP1 is not a component of selenite induced SGs ( XREF_FIG B ) ( 4EBP1 antibody was validated for use in immunofluorescence in Supplementary Figure S2C , where 4EBP1 signal was strongly reduced by siRNA mediated depletion of this protein ) . ++++ In situ hybridization using an oligo-dT 18 probe demonstrated strong accumulation of poly-A-containing mRNA in selenite induced SGs ( XREF_FIG B ) . ++++ Thus , selenite induced SGs are morphologically and compositionally distinct from canonical SGs . ++++ More intriguingly , among the four canonical SG components whose recruitment to SGs promotes cell survival ( Rsk2 , RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) , three of them ( RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) failed to accumulate in selenite induced SGs . ++++ Composition of selenite induced SGs .
To compare the compositions of selenite- and arsenite induced SGs , we first stained for core SG components , namely , translation initiation factors that constitute the 48S pre and initiation complex . ++++ In contrast , RACK1 , importin alpha1 and beta1 and HDAC6 , which are known components of arsenite induced SGs , are excluded from selenite induced SGs , at least in U2OS cells ( XREF_FIG C , compare with Supplementary Figure S2 ) . ++++ We noticed that selenite induced SGs are generally smaller and found closer to the cell periphery than arsenite induced SGs . ++++ Moreover , SGs induced in cells exposed to both selenite and arsenite resemble arsenite induced SGs with respect to their large size and the recruitment of eIF3b . ++++ Taken together , our data suggest that mammalian cells assemble two classes of SGs with different components , mechanisms of assembly and physiological roles : Type 1 SGs , induced by arsenite and other types of stress , typically contain eIF3 subunits and small ribosomal proteins , are dependent on eIF2alpha phosphorylation or eIF4A activity and function to promote cell survival during stress . ++++ In contrast , eIF5A , eIF3e and Int6 and the small ribosomal protein Rps14 are only weakly recruited or absent in selenite induced SGs ( compare with arsenite induced SGs shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and XREF_FIG B ) .
We found that selenite potently inhibits translation and induces the ROS dependent assembly of SGs that lack the pro survival proteins found in typical SGs . ++++ Selenite induced cytotoxicity is a consequence of ROS that accumulate during selenite metabolism . ++++ We also observed selenite specific loss of phospho-ribosomal S6 protein ; considering the increased eIF4E-4EBP1 interaction and apparent dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 ( XREF_FIG A ) , it seems likely that mTOR activity is down-regulated by selenite , a possible consequence of selenite induced ROS ( XREF_FIG B ) . ++++ Thus , selenite induced ROS production is primarily responsible for the suppression of S6- and 4EBP1 phosphorylation , but this is not the case for the induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation .
Thus , SGs are thought to promote cell survival under stress conditions through modulation of various aspects of cell metabolism . ++++ More intriguingly , among the four canonical SG components whose recruitment to SGs promotes cell survival ( Rsk2 , RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) , three of them ( RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) failed to accumulate in selenite induced SGs .

Selenite targets eIF4E binding protein-1 to inhibit translation initiation and induce the assembly of non canonical stress granules .
However , siRNA mediated depletion of 4EBP1 clearly inhibits selenite induced SG assembly , but not arsenite induced SG assembly ( XREF_FIG C and D ) .
To determine whether selenite has the ability to induce SGs , U2OS cells were treated with various concentrations of sodium selenite , followed by immunostaining for the SG markers , TIAR and G3BP .

It may be that phosphorylation of eIF2alpha provides a pool of translationally repressed mRNPs , from which 4EBP mediated sequestration of eIF4E from eIF4F complex and subsequent aggregation into discrete foci preferentially occurs .
Unlike SGs induced by glucose deprivation , yeasts treated with sodium azide assemble SGs that more closely resemble their mammalian counterparts , indicating that yeast cells can assemble more than one class of SGs .
Selenite targets eIF4E binding protein-1 to inhibit translation initiation and induce the assembly of non canonical stress granules .
Although arsenite treatment does not trigger SG formation in these knock-in ( S51A ) MEFs , pateamine A , which induces SGs in a phospho-eIF2alpha-independent manner , does ( XREF_FIG C ) .
In contrast , eIF5A , eIF3e and Int6 and the small ribosomal protein Rps14 are only weakly recruited or absent in selenite induced SGs ( compare with arsenite induced SGs shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and XREF_FIG B ) .
In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , glucose deprivation induces mRNA containing cytoplasmic granules that accumulate eIF4E , eIF4G and PABP ( EGP-bodies ) , but not eIF3 or 40S ribosomal subunits .
Although the mechanism of this tumor cell specific cytotoxicity is not fully understood , cancer cells may be particularly susceptible to ROS induced by selenium metabolism .
To examine the physiological role of 4EBP1 in the selenite induced stress response , we compared the viability of U2OS cells treated with 4EBP1 specific cells or control siRNA transfected cells .
In addition , there was an apparent decrease in total eIF4G ( XREF_FIG A ) , which may contribute to selenite triggered translational repression ( XREF_FIG A ) .
These results indicate that 4EBP1 contributes to the cytotoxic effect of selenite , but not arsenite .
To examine the physiological role of 4EBP1 in the selenite induced stress response , we compared the viability of U2OS cells treated with 4EBP1 specific cells or control siRNA transfected cells .
This is unlikely to be due to apoptosis , since apoptosis induced proteolysis of eIF4G should produce a 120-kDa cleavage product that is recognized by the antibody that we are using .
The lack of eIF3b suggests that the selenite induced SGs are different from not only arsenite induced SGs but also SGs triggered by many other stimuli in mammalian cells .
In contrast , eIF5A , eIF3e and Int6 and the small ribosomal protein Rps14 are only weakly recruited or absent in selenite induced SGs ( compare with arsenite induced SGs shown in Supplementary Figure S2 and XREF_FIG B ) .

More intriguingly , among the four canonical SG components whose recruitment to SGs promotes cell survival ( Rsk2 , RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) , three of them ( RACK1 , importin alpha1 and HDAC6 ) failed to accumulate in selenite induced SGs .
In addition to the induction of ROS , selenium compounds trigger endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress , which results in phosphorylation of eIF2alpha .
The association of 4EBP1 with the cap is selectively increased by selenite , suggesting that selenite disrupts the eIF4F complex by enhancing binding of 4EBP1 to eIF4E .

Dephosphorylation of neither 4EBP1 nor ribosomal S6 protein was observed by arsenite ( XREF_FIG A ) , and the superoxide dismutase mimetic MnTMPyP failed to inhibit arsenite induced SG assembly , in stark contrast to selenite induced SG assembly ( XREF_FIG A ) .
Inhibition of ROS generation by MnTMPyP significantly restored the levels of phosphorylated S6 protein and 4EBP1 , whereas selenite induced phosphorylation of eIF2alpha was only weakly attenuated ( XREF_FIG B ) .
In fact , levels of phospho-4EBP1 and ribosomal protein S6 are strongly reduced by selenite treatment in whole-cell extracts , further suggesting that selenite inhibits mTOR activity in these cells ( XREF_FIG A , lower panel ) .
In order to determine whether selenite induced SG assembly requires eIF2alpha phosphorylation , we used a MEF cell line in which wild-type ( WT ) eIF2alpha is replaced with a non phosphorylatable mutant ( eIF2alphaS51A ) . ++++ In accordance with previous reports , selenite induces the phosphorylation of eIF2alpha , which probably contributes to translational repression ( XREF_FIG B ) .
The involvement of mTOR may explain the lack of eIF3 accumulation considering a previous study showing the mTOR stimulated association between eIF4G and eIF3 .
However , siRNA mediated depletion of 4EBP1 clearly inhibits selenite induced SG assembly , but not arsenite induced SG assembly ( XREF_FIG C and D ) .
Expression of dominant negative p53 conferred partial resistance to apoptosis induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase . ++++ 36 Inhibition of PI-3 kinase rapidly induced apoptosis in both wild-type Rat-1 cells and cells expressing dominant negative p53 , as indicated by DNA fragmentation as early as 1h after treating with PI-103 ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR The role of representative p53 target genes ( Atrogin-1 , Gadd45A , Nupr1 , Tp53inp1 and Txnip ) in apoptosis induced by PI 3-kinase inhibition was tested by siRNA knockdowns ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR Signaling by PI 3-kinase downstream of growth factor receptors is required to suppress apoptosis of most mammalian cell types , as well as acting to stimulate cell proliferation .
To further characterize the roles of FOXO , MITF , USF1 and p53 in the transcriptional program activated by PI-3 kinase inhibition , we identified transcription factor binding sites that were overrepresented in the upstream regions of the genes induced by PI 3-kinase inhibition in Rat-1 cells . ++++ Similarly , binding of MITF was detected to predicted E-box sites upstream of six of the genes induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Computational analysis , as previously described , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR was used to identify predicted binding sites that were conserved in human and rat sequences and were statistically overrepresented in the genes induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase .
Consistent with the partial effect of p53 on gene induction , the genes induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in Rat-1 cells were also targeted by FOXO , MITF and USF1 transcription factors , as previously reported in human T98G cells . ++++ However , the induction of some genes that were dependent on p53 ( Flcn , Hoxc5 , Loc688916 and Txnip ) ( XREF_FIG ) was not significantly reduced by inhibition of GSK3 , consistent with the induction of these genes by other transcription factors or with the possibility that inhibition of PI-3 kinase can also activate p53 independently of GSK3 activity .
In this study , we confirmed this mechanism by demonstrating phosphorylation of Tip60 and acetylation of p53 in response to PI 3-kinase inhibition , both of which were blocked by inhibition of GSK3 . ++++ These results indicated that activation of GSK3 following inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to activation of p53 via acetylation .
However , some p53 dependent genes were unaffected by inhibition of GSK3 , suggesting that inhibition of PI 3-kinase may also lead to activation of p53 by other mechanisms , possibly as a result of phosphorylation of p53 by other stress activated protein kinases , such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase .
Wild-type Rat-1 cells and Rat-1 cells expressing dominant negative p53 were treated with PI-103 for 1h to identify changes in gene expression coinciding with the onset of apoptosis .
12 The finding that GSK3 reduced but did not eliminate apoptosis is also consistent with the direct effects of Akt on other proapoptotic effectors , including FOXO XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR and Bad .
Approximately 70 % of the genes targeted by p53 were also targeted by FOXO , and nearly 50 % of the genes targeted by p53 were also targeted by both FOXO and E-box-binding factors , indicating synergistic gene regulation by the transcription factors acting downstream of PI 3-kinase signaling . ++++ Many of the genes targeted by p53 were also targeted by FOXO and E-box-binding transcription factors , indicating that p53 functions coordinately with these factors to regulate gene expression downstream of PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK3 signaling . ++++ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR Notably , many of the genes targeted by p53 were co-regulated by FOXO and E-box transcription factors . ++++ There was substantial overlap in the genes targeted by FOXO , MITF , USF1 and p53 ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Approximately 70 % of the genes targeted by p53 were also targeted by FOXO , and nearly 50 % of the genes targeted by p53 were also targeted by both FOXO and E-box-binding factors , indicating synergistic gene regulation by the transcription factors acting downstream of PI 3-kinase signaling .
We therefore sought to determine whether inhibition of GSK3 blocked transcriptional activation of p53 target genes following PI 3-kinase inhibition ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ GSK3 mediates activation of p53 in response to PI-3 kinase inhibition . ++++ 30 As inhibition of PI 3-kinase leads to activation of GSK3 , we sought to determine whether GSK3 was responsible for activation of p53 by this mechanism .
A total of 12 genes were targeted by p53 , with nine of these genes also targeted by FOXO and six targeted by both FOXO and the E-box factors . ++++ There was substantial overlap in the genes targeted by FOXO , MITF , USF1 and p53 ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , the induction of some genes that were dependent on p53 ( Flcn , Hoxc5 , Loc688916 and Txnip ) ( XREF_FIG ) was not significantly reduced by inhibition of GSK3 , consistent with the induction of these genes by other transcription factors or with the possibility that inhibition of PI-3 kinase can also activate p53 independently of GSK3 activity .
However , some p53 dependent genes were unaffected by inhibition of GSK3 , suggesting that inhibition of PI 3-kinase may also lead to activation of p53 by other mechanisms , possibly as a result of phosphorylation of p53 by other stress activated protein kinases , such as the c-Jun N-terminal kinase .
There was substantial overlap in the genes targeted by FOXO , MITF , USF1 and p53 ( XREF_FIG ) .
The upregulation of 14 of these genes was significantly inhibited in the Rat-1 clones expressing dominant negative p53 , indicating that p53 contributed to their induction following inhibition of PI 3-kinase ( XREF_FIG ) .
30 GSK3 phosphorylation on serine 86 activates Tip60 , which then activates p53 via acetylation of lysine 120 .
XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR In addition , many of the genes induced following inhibition of PI 3-kinase were targeted by the E-box-binding transcription factors MITF and USF1 , which were activated as a result of phosphorylation by GSK3 .
36 Inhibition of PI-3 kinase rapidly induced apoptosis in both wild-type Rat-1 cells and cells expressing dominant negative p53 , as indicated by DNA fragmentation as early as 1h after treating with PI-103 ( XREF_FIG ) .
There was substantial overlap in the genes targeted by FOXO , MITF , USF1 and p53 ( XREF_FIG ) .
As in the case of FOXO , the genes targeted by MITF and USF1 included both genes whose induction was inhibited ( Atrogin-1 , Ccng2 , Gadd45A , Hbp1 , Hoxc5 and Txnip ) and whose induction was unaffected by dominant negative p53 ( Nr1d1 ) .
46 Inhibition of GSK3 also reduced , but did not completely block , apoptosis resulting from inhibition of PI 3-kinase in both wild-type Rat-1 cells and cells expressing dominant negative p53 .
Inhibition of GSK3 significantly inhibited apoptosis induced by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in both wild-type Rat-1 cells and in the DN1 and DN2 cells expressing the dominant negative p53 mutant ( XREF_FIG ) .
Wild-type Rat-1 cells and Rat-1 cells expressing dominant negative p53 were treated with PI-103 for 1h to identify changes in gene expression coinciding with the onset of apoptosis .

This is consistent with previous reports that p53 contributes to apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR and indicates that p53 is one of the effectors contributing to cell death when PI 3-kinase signaling is blocked .
Bioinformatic analysis , chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) and RNA interference further allowed us to identify key transcription factors that were regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling and contributed to these changes in gene expression .
Likewise , inhibition of PI 3-kinase increased the acetylation of p53 lysine 120 by three-to-four-fold ( XREF_FIG ) .
45 Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage and other forms of cell stress is generally mediated by inhibition of p53 degradation , leading to increased intracellular p53 levels . ++++ 45 Activation of p53 in response to DNA damage and other forms of cell stress is generally mediated by inhibition of p53 degradation , leading to increased intracellular p53 levels .
Inhibition of PI 3-kinase similarly resulted in GSK3 dependent phosphorylation of Tip60 ( XREF_FIG ) and acetylation of p53 ( XREF_FIG ) in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells . ++++ The principal mechanism leading to activation of p53 in response to inhibition of PI 3-kinase is phosphorylation of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 by GSK3 , leading to acetylation and activation of p53 .
The principal mechanism leading to activation of p53 in response to inhibition of PI 3-kinase is phosphorylation of the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 by GSK3 , leading to acetylation and activation of p53 .
USF1 bound to the predicted E-box sequences upstream of the same six genes targeted by MITF , as well as to sequences upstream of Nr1d1 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Instead , activation of p53 was mediated primarily by a recently described pathway 30 in which GSK3 phosphorylates and activates the lysine acetyltransferase Tip60 , which then activates p53 by acetylation .
Thus , while individual knockdowns demonstrate that distinct PDGFR signaling can regulate Oct4 and Nanog expression , a combination of PDGFR and cAbl inhibition is required for cell shape change and increased MSC potency . ++++ PDGFR Inhibition Induced MSC Shape Change Was MEK and JAK Dependent . ++++ PDGFR Inhibitor-IV Induced an MSC Shape Change .
Conversely , inhibiting MEK may restore ROCK activity and actomyosin contractility , which rescues the elongated shape . ++++ Moreover , active MEK can downregulate Rho associated kinase ( ROCK ) activity , decreases actin stress fiber assembly and actomyosin contractility , while MEK inhibition restores ROCK activity [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Active MEK can downregulate ROCK activity , decreasing actin stress fiber assembly and actomyosin contractility , whereas MEK inhibition can restore ROCK activity [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Thus , PDGFR inhibitor-IV preferentially upregulated Oct4A .
EGFR signaling is known to activate Rac1 [ XREF_BIBR ] , which also regulates actomyosin contractility and cell shape , thus EGFR activated Rac1 may not only support PDGFR inhibitor-IV induced cell rounding but also STAT3 nuclear import .

While both PDGFRs can activate the same phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) , PLCgamma , and mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathways , each receptor can induce distinct cellular responses [ XREF_BIBR ] .
An important distinction between the two compounds is that PDGFR inhibitor-IV also inhibits cAbl activity ( IC 50 = 22 nM ) , while PDGFR inhibitor-V has little or no effect on cAbl ( IC 50 > 1 muM ) ( Supporting Information Table 1 ) .

Strikingly p68 depletion resulted in a significant reduction of both basal and etoposide induced p21 mRNA levels while there was no reduction in the expression of Bax mRNA in cells treated with p68 or p21 siRNA ( XREF_FIG ) ; instead there was a minor but reproducible and statistically significant increase in etoposide induced Bax mRNA levels .
In order to investigate the importance of p68 in the p53 response to DNA damage in vivo , p68KO ( Cre + ) and Cre - controls were treated with tamoxifen to induce Cre and then subjected to 2 Gy gamma irradiation ( a standard dose for patients receiving radiotherapy ) .

p68 is required for the DNA damage induced G1/S cell cycle checkpoint but has no effect on the induction of apoptosis .
In a previous study we observed that p68 siRNA knockdown also inhibited induction of Fas and PIG3 upon etoposide treatment .
Since p68 has been shown to be important for recruitment of other transcriptional regulators to certain promoters we reasoned that one mechanism by which p68 could selectively modulate induction of certain p53-target genes in response to DNA damage might be through differentially regulating the recruitment of p53 , and/or of other components of the transcriptional machinery , to specific promoters .

Although there was little p53 induction in the liver there was a strong p53 dependent p21 induction in the control mice , which was absent in the mice lacking p68 , underscoring the requirement for p68 and indicating that only low levels of p53 induction are required to induce significant levels of p21 .

Consistently , we found that after glutamine starvation the maintenance of FoxO1 activity by knocking down XBP-1u was sufficient to decrease cell viability in an autophagy dependent manner ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) .
The cell death was greatly suppressed by 3-MA , verifying the role of autophagy in cell death caused by XBP-1 knockdown upon glutamine starvation ( XREF_FIG ) .
Second , it was found that FoxO1 degradation occurred only in the cytoplasm and that XBP-1u directly interacted with FoxO1 ( XREF_FIG , XREF_FIG , XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) ; however , XBP-1s was found to be localized to nucleus , which would make it difficult to directly induce FoxO1 degradation in response to glutamine starvation .
FoxO1 is also degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in Fao hepatoma cells , a process mediated by COP1 -- a RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase 21 .

XBP-1s ( or ATF6 ) forms a complex with XBP-1u that is degraded by the proteasome ; the degradation domain in the C-terminus of XBP-1u is critical for the interaction between XBP-1u and 20S proteasome XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .

In our experiments , SMRT exerts a basal repressive function on NFkappaB genes , as its removal from the cells by siRNA induces up-regulation of NFkappaB targets such as PPM1D ( XREF_FIG ) as well as IL-8 and TNF-alpha ( data not shown ) .
Interestingly , SMRT was required for CDDP induced repression of the Wip1 phosphatase ( PPM1D gene , XREF_FIG ) , a major down-regulator of the Chk2 pathway , as well as of other phosphorylated proteins such as p53 and p38 XREF_BIBR .
In contrast , active recruitment of SMRT on the promoter of AP1 targets such as c-FOS occurs only after DNA damage .
To study the role of NCoR and SMRT in CDDP induced gene transcription , U2OS cells were transfected with siRNAs against SMRT or NCoR , and 48 hours later treated with 100 microM CDDP for 6 h to induce damage and activate Chk2 .
SMRT , but not NCoR , significantly affects DNA damage induced transcription .
It is generally accepted that DNA damage activates initially both pro apoptotic and anti-apoptotic pathways , each one subjected to subtle and complex regulation by different stimuli and transcription factors , and that the overall balance between genes promoting survival and genes inducing death signals dictates the cellular outcome XREF_BIBR .
However , if the cells were transfected with siRNA specific for SMRT , the ability of the antioxidant to rescue the DNA damage induced apoptosis was lost ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that SMRT is involved in monitoring repair and shutting down the response if the DNA damage is repaired .
As shown in XREF_FIG , while the siRNAs against Chk2 had little effect on the activation of caspase 3 , knock-down of SMRT increased PARP cleavage in CDDP treated cells .
As shown in XREF_FIG , SMRT limited CDDP dependent activation of FOS and PPM1D and exhibited a repressive function on SMAD7 , SRPK2 , BCL2L11 and MAX , as their inhibition by CDDP was lost in the cells transfected with SMRT siRNA .
Indeed , treatment of the cells with exogenous TNF-alpha has an effect on caspase activation similar to that of siRNA for SMRT : increased doxorubicin induced apoptosis , which can be rescued by siRNA for Wip1 ( data not shown ) .

Interestingly , when the cells transfected with the SMRT siRNA were also treated with a Wip1 inhibitor , the single peak of Chk2 activation ( XREF_FIG , upper panel ) was replaced by two peaks of activation after doxorubicin treatment , one at 40 '-50' and one at 70 ' ( XREF_FIG , lower panel ) .
The microarray profiling showed that treatment with CDDP induced a massive wave of gene repression , with negatively regulated genes ( 1074 ) being twice as frequent as positively regulated ( 507 ) ones ( XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , suggesting that transcriptional repression is an important aspect of the response to CDDP induced DNA damage .

While knock-down of SMRT caused an increase in doxorubicin induced caspase 3 activation , co-treatment with a chemical inhibitor of Wip1 attenuated this phenotype ( XREF_FIG ) .
As expected , Wip1 protein levels were augmented by doxorubicin treatment and increased by siRNA against SMRT , even in the absence of DNA damage , indicating basal repression of PPM1D by SMRT ( XREF_FIG ) .
Amongst them , SMRT is responsible for basal repression of Wip1 , a phosphatase that de-phosphorylates and inactivates Chk2 , thus affecting a feedback loop responsible for licensing the correct timing of Chk2 activation and the proper execution of the DNA repair process .

At the higher level of expression , p21 stabilized cyclin D3-CDK4 complexes but inhibited their pRb-kinase activity ( XREF_FIG ) and also substantially reduced CDK4 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ This too might suffice to prevent phosphorylation and activation of CDK4 complexes , as observed in response to proteasome inhibition by MG132 .
Here again , the T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 as well as S130 phosphorylation of p21 were inhibited by roscovitine ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Importantly , T172 phosphorylation of CDK4 was completely inhibited by roscovitine in wt cells but not in p21-null cells ( XREF_FIG ) .

As for CDK2 dependent phosphorylation of p21 on S130 in vitro XREF_BIBR , deletion of the C-terminal Cy2 cyclin binding site much reduced p21 phosphorylation in HCT116 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) , suggesting that in cyclin D/CDK4 bound p21 the interaction with other active cyclin-CDK complexes to phosphorylate S130 is mediated by the Cy2 site . ++++ Previous reports have indicated that S130 phosphorylation of p21 can be catalyzed by CDK2 to form a phosphodegron recognized by the SCF and Skp2 ubiquitin ligase complex and to signal the proteasomal degradation of cyclin and CDK bound p21 , which is required for S-phase entry XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR .

Whether both CDK4 and CDK6 phosphorylations are catalyzed by CDK7 remains unclear .
In vivo , both S130 phosphorylation of p21 and T172 phosphorylation of p21 bound CDK4 were inhibited not only in response to CDK7 inhibition , but also in response to increased p21 expression and inhibition of CDK2 ( by roscovitine and CR8 ) and CDK4/6 ( by PD0332991 ) .

We observed that CDK4 and CDK6 , associated with cyclin D3 and cyclin D1 , also phosphorylated p21 complexed with D-type cyclins and CDK4 in vitro ( XREF_FIG ; XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
pRb phosphorylation is then maintained independently of cyclins D , and hence of mitogens , by a positive feedback loop linking pRb to E2F dependent transcription of cyclin E , which leads to CDK2 activation and further phosphorylation of pRb XREF_BIBR .
CDK4 was not phosphorylated by recombinant CDK2 and CDK4 complexes in these experiments ( not shown ) .
CDK4 activation correlates with S130 phosphorylation of p21 , which is prevented by CDK7 inhibition .
Inhibition of CDK4 phosphorylation by roscovitine and PD0332991 depended on p21 .

The model depicted in XREF_FIG assembles our main observations : CDK7 is required for CDK4 activation in vivo , but this requirement is conditioned by CDK4 binding to p21 , and other CDK4 activating kinases must exist to phosphorylate p21-unbound CDK4 during CDK7 inhibition .
In vivo , both S130 phosphorylation of p21 and T172 phosphorylation of p21 bound CDK4 were inhibited not only in response to CDK7 inhibition , but also in response to increased p21 expression and inhibition of CDK2 ( by roscovitine and CR8 ) and CDK4/6 ( by PD0332991 ) .
Intriguingly , CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6 , but for CDK4 this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21 cip1 .
The S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation , and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21 bound CDK4 .

Intriguingly , in the " low p21 " setting , the co-expression of cyclin D3-CDK4 induced the phosphorylation of p21 at S130 and less abundantly at S98 ( as shown by comparison with S130A and S98A mutants ) ( XREF_FIG ) .
As the phosphorylations of p21 depended on CDK7 activity , we hypothesize that they could have been catalyzed by CDKs , which phosphorylate S/T-P motifs .

21 This effect may vary in different cancer cell lines and some factors affected by mutant KRAS knockdown may subsequently enhance AKT activity in certain cancer cells .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the IC 50 value of gefitinib in H460 treatment was 16.4 muM , which was higher than that in A549 or Calu1 treatment , suggesting that comutant KRAS and PIK3CA might further decrease the chemosensitivity of gefitinib .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the IC 50 value of gefitinib in H460 treatment was 16.4 muM , which was higher than that in A549 or Calu1 treatment , suggesting that comutant KRAS and PIK3CA might further decrease the chemosensitivity of gefitinib .
The present study shows that atorvastatin at the relative low dose ( 1muM ) works effectively to disrupt the direct interaction of Kras with PI3K but not Raf , whereas a high dose ( 5muM ) of atorvastatin can inhibit the interaction of mutant Kras to Raf .
Next we explored the mechanisms underlying atorvastatin mediated increase in gefitinib sensitivity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG ( curve lines ) , atorvastatin dose dependently enhanced gefitinib efficacy in comutant KRAS and PTEN H157 cells ( gefitinib treatment versus 1 or 5muM atorvastatin+ gefitinib treatment , IC 50 = 18 versus 2.08 or 0.71 muM ) . ++++ We then observed whether atorvastatin enhanced the pro apoptotic effect of gefitinib in A549 cells with the comutant KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN by flow cytometry assay . ++++ Atorvastatin could still enhance gefitinib efficacy in H460 cells ( gefitinib treatment versus 1 or 5muM atorvastatin+ gefitinib treatment , IC 50 = 16.4 versus 4.06 or 1muM ) . ++++ Atorvastatin ( 5muM ) further enhanced the gefitinib cytotoxicity through concomitant inhibition of AKT and ERK activity . ++++ A similar increase in caspase 3/7 activity was reflected in the apoptotic index of A549 parental cell , or its other two mutant status , suggesting that the addition of atorvastatin significantly enhances the same concentration of gefitinib for reaching the threshold of caspase activation and apoptosis in KRAS mutant alone , or in the comutant KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN status of A549 cells ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG , atorvastatin could also enhance the gefitinib efficacy in these transfected cells , confirming that atorvastatin can sensitize NSCLC cells to gefitinib in the presence of comutant KRAS and PIK3CA .
As shown in XREF_FIG , atorvastatin treatment led to a time dependent dissociation of the PI3K p110alpha subunit from Kras corresponded with inhibition of the PI3K and AKT pathway in A549 cells , as well as comutant KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN A549 cells .
The similar AKT or ERK inhibitory effect mediated by atorvastatin alone or in the presence of 1muM gefitinib was also obtained in Calu1 cells and their KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutants ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , how mutant KRAS mediates gefitinib resistance in NSCLC treatment is still a puzzle .
Mutant KRAS mediated PI3K and Raf pathway is critical for gefitinib resistance .
However , 1muM atorvastatin alone or combined with 1muM gefitinib could not induce the ERK inhibition of A549 cell and its KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutant until the dose of atorvastatin was elevated to 5muM ( XREF_FIG ) .
As shown in XREF_FIG , although mutant PTEN increased the gefitinib concentration required for inhibition of proliferation of KRAS mutant NSCLC cells ( A549 and Calu1 cells ) , addition of 1 or 5muM atorvastatin could sensitize comutant KRAS and PTEN NSCLC cells to gefitinib compared with each agent alone .
Next we explored the mechanisms underlying atorvastatin mediated increase in gefitinib sensitivity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells .
However , 1muM atorvastatin alone or combined with 1muM gefitinib could not induce the ERK inhibition of A549 cell and its KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutant until the dose of atorvastatin was elevated to 5muM ( XREF_FIG ) .
However , 1muM atorvastatin alone or combined with 1muM gefitinib could not induce the ERK inhibition of A549 cell and its KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutant until the dose of atorvastatin was elevated to 5muM ( XREF_FIG ) .
As shown in XREF_FIG , gefitinib dose dependently increased the apoptotic rate and caspase 3/7 activity in Calu3 parental cells , whereas exerted minimal or low effects in KRAS mutant Calu3 cells .
To demonstrate whether comutant KRAS and PIK3CA mediates gefitinib resistance in NSCLC treatment , the H460 NSCLC cell line harboring comutant KRAS and PIK3CA was chosen .
Atorvastatin ( 1muM ) plus gefitinib treatment inhibited proliferation , promoted cell apoptosis , and reduced the AKT activity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells compared with gefitinib alone .
Additional administration of 1 or 5muM atorvastatin enhanced the inhibitory effect of gefitinib ( 1muM ) on AKT activation in A549 parental cell and its KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutants ( XREF_FIG ) .
Additional administration of 1 or 5muM atorvastatin enhanced the inhibitory effect of gefitinib ( 1muM ) on AKT activation in A549 parental cell and its KRAS and PIK3CA or KRAS and PTEN comutants ( XREF_FIG ) .
The results that mevalonate administration reverses the effects of atorvastatin on Kras and Raf and Kras and PI3K complexes suggest that atorvastatin disrupts Kras and Raf and Kras and PI3K complexes in NSCLC cells through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase . ++++ Furthermore , our data show that atorvastatin can also disrupt the Kras and Raf and Kras and PI3K complexes in comutant KRAS and PIK3CA and KRAS and PTEN NSCLC cells , leading to decreased ERK and AKT activities .
Persistent activation of PI3K signaling by the PIK3CA oncogenic mutation is sufficient to abrogate gefitinib induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells .
As shown in XREF_FIG , 1muM gefitinib time dependently inhibited the expression of pAKT and pERK in Calu3 cells .
Therefore , combined with the finding that gefitinib shows antitumor activity mainly via the blockage of downstream MEK and ERK and PI3K and AKT signaling pathways , 13 the present study suggests that the failure of gefitinib to disrupt the Kras and Raf and Kras and PI3K complexes contributes to mutant KRAS mediated gefitinib resistance in NSCLC cells .
As shown in XREF_FIG , 1muM gefitinib time dependently inhibited the expression of pAKT and pERK in Calu3 cells .
The possible reason may be that lovastatin may also disrupt the Kras and Raf and Kras and PI3K complexes , which makes the effect of lovastatin on AKT activity in these cells complicated .
Gefitinib disrupted the Kras and PI3K and Kras and Raf complexes in Calu3 cells , whereas not in Calu3 KRAS mutant cells .

In order to investigate whether a NPM and ARF nucleoplasmic complex is responsible for inhibition of MDM2 , we performed large-scale stepwise purification of ARF from HeLa nuclear lysates and identified a high molecular weight complex that elutes after consecutive fractionations ( ion exchange and size exclusion separation columns ) containing both NPM and MDM2 in a highly purified protein fraction , indicating a strong molecular interaction between the constituents of the complex ( lower MonoQ fractions A11 & A12 , XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ In agreement , failure to re-localize NPM to the nucleoplasm prevents NPM mediated inhibition of MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Our results suggest that inhibition of MDM2 by NPM and ARF are not independent and respond to cellular stress via disruption of NPM oligomerization . ++++ Our data argues for a model whereby MDM2 is inhibited by a nucleoplasmic pool of NPM associated ARF .
The data presented above suggests that inhibition of AKT promotes increased turnover of p53 mut . ++++ This supports previous data on AKT mediated targeting of MDM2 and our current observations , as AKT can promote either negative or positive regulation of p53 depending on the presence of ARF and its ability to restrict MDM2 activity in the nucleoplasm ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ Inhibition of AKT relieves the p53 mut suppression of p73 . ++++ We therefore wished to extend these observations in order to determine if inhibition of AKT could modulate p53 mut stability and responses to IR in-vivo .
ARF has been reported to promote p53 stability by sequestering MDM2 to the nucleolus [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , whereas others have reported that nucleoplasmic ARF suppresses MDM2 activity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Although ARF has long been recognized as an inhibitor of MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , debate exists regarding the cellular location and mechanism of ARF mediated MDM2 inhibition . ++++ Given that ARF has been proposed to inhibit MDM2 in the nucleoplasm and nucleolar localization of ARF protects it from degradation , a conundrum exists regarding the mechanism that allows NPM to restrict ARF nucleolar accumulation and thereby allow MDM2 inhibition [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] In this article we identify that AKT regulates both ARF stability and localization at the nucleolus . ++++ This in turn promotes ARF mediated inhibition of MDM2 in the nucleoplasm .
AKT promotes the inhibition of MDM2 through a nucleoplasmic NPM and ARF complex . ++++ This in turn promotes ARF mediated inhibition of MDM2 in the nucleoplasm . ++++ Since inhibition of AKT promotes ARF localization to the nucleolus and enhanced MDM2 activity , we wished to address what effect increased MDM2 activity has on endogenous p53 .
Since inhibition of AKT promotes ARF localization to the nucleolus and enhanced MDM2 activity , we wished to address what effect increased MDM2 activity has on endogenous p53 . ++++ This in turn promotes ARF mediated inhibition of MDM2 in the nucleoplasm . ++++ Therefore , we can conclude that elevated AKT activity restricts ARF accumulation at the nucleolus .
Furthermore , our results indicate that p53 mut is degraded by MDM2 as Nutlin3A treatment stabilizes protein levels both in the presence and absence of ARF , implying that constitutive MDM2 activity in the absence of ARF keeps p53 mut levels low . ++++ Growing evidence suggests that since MDM2 can mediate degradation of p53 mut in normal tissue [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] the stabilization of p53 mut is not due to the lack of transcriptional activation of MDM2 .
In T24 cells , where NPM is phosphorylated on Ser48 , inhibition of AKT decreases the monomeric fraction of NPM ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and increases NPM oligomers ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ Thus , oncogenic activation of AKT disrupts NPM quaternary dynamics via phosphorylation of Ser48 .
Inhibition of AKT relieves the p53 mut suppression of p73 .
This supports previous data on AKT mediated targeting of MDM2 and our current observations , as AKT can promote either negative or positive regulation of p53 depending on the presence of ARF and its ability to restrict MDM2 activity in the nucleoplasm ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
PI3K and AKT inhibitors , such as PI-103 and MK-2206 have been investigated as single agents , but their potential as combination agents in specific patient cohorts is anticipated to be where the greatest effectiveness of these agents will be identified [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
The potent tumor suppressor functions of p53 require that the activity of this protein is under tight control to prevent unnecessary induction of apoptosis or cellular senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
A classical gain of function phenotype associated with p53 mut is the inhibition of the p53 family member p73 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
PI3K and AKT inhibitors , such as PI-103 and MK-2206 have been investigated as single agents , but their potential as combination agents in specific patient cohorts is anticipated to be where the greatest effectiveness of these agents will be identified [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Indeed NPM has been proposed to sequester ARF in the nucleolus , preventing it from inhibiting MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Co-expression of K-Ras V12 , thereby enhancing PI3K-AKT activity , similarly disrupts pentameric NPM but not NPM-S48A ( data not shown ) .
Our results show that the clinical candidate AKT inhibitor MK-2206 promotes ARF nucleolar localization , reduced p53 mut stability and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer .
Since inhibition of AKT promotes ARF localization to the nucleolus and enhanced MDM2 activity , we wished to address what effect increased MDM2 activity has on endogenous p53 .
To determine whether phospho-S48-NPM affects p53 mut levels in-vivo , we stained serial sections of SQ20B xenografts from mice treated with either DMSO or PI-103 and observed decreased phospho-S48-NPM positivity and reduced levels of p53 mut in PI-103 treated animals ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
HSP not only directly stabilize p53 mut , they also inhibit E3 ligases ( MDM2 and CHIP ) responsible for p53 ubiquitination .
As p73 shares many transcriptional targets with p53 , activation of p73 following DNA damage can be inhibited by high stable levels of p53 mut through dominant negative suppression of classical p53 targets [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
To determine whether phospho-S48-NPM affects p53 mut levels in-vivo , we stained serial sections of SQ20B xenografts from mice treated with either DMSO or PI-103 and observed decreased phospho-S48-NPM positivity and reduced levels of p53 mut in PI-103 treated animals ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
We have found that AKT limits NPM oligomerisation , which in turn restricts NPM nucleolar localization and accumulation of ARF at the nucleolus .
The potent tumor suppressor functions of p53 require that the activity of this protein is under tight control to prevent unnecessary induction of apoptosis or cellular senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Inhibition of AKT decreases p53 mut stability in a NPM and ARF dependent manner . ++++ We interpret this as an inability of AKT to target oligomeric NPM due to Ser48 inaccessibility in the pentameric ring , but also that the cycling pool of NPM can be phosphorylated and prevented from forming pentamers , which prevents NPM : ARF sequestration rather than disrupting localization . ++++ We can also assume that AKT promotes MDM2 nuclear localisation , but that its activity is controlled by the AKT mediated NPM-ARF nucleoplasmic pool once there . ++++ In T24 cells , where NPM is phosphorylated on Ser48 , inhibition of AKT decreases the monomeric fraction of NPM ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) and increases NPM oligomers ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Our results suggest that AKT contributes to this effect by stabilizing p53 mut protein , however , previous reports indicate that AKT reduces p53 levels via nuclear targeting of MDM2 . ++++ Inhibition of AKT decreases p53 mut stability in a NPM and ARF dependent manner . ++++ Furthermore , growing evidence suggests that AKT activity can mediate p53 stabilization and induction of senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Inhibition of AKT with MK-2206 mediates reduction in p53 mut and clonogenic survival upon exposure to IR , suggesting that the mechanistic regulation of NPM dynamics and ARF localization correlates with therapeutic resistance to DNA damage .
NPM mediated sequestration of ARF to the nucleolus is reported to increase ARF protein stability by preventing ubiquitin mediated degradation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Oligomerisation of NPM promotes accumulation of ARF at the nucleolus but appears incompatible with MDM2 association ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
The NPM mediated sequestration of ARF in the nucleolus has been proposed to increase MDM2 activity in the nucleoplasm [ XREF_BIBR ] and furthermore , relocalization of ARF from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm is associated with the increased formation of ARF and MDM2 complexes [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ ARF has been reported to promote p53 stability by sequestering MDM2 to the nucleolus [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , whereas others have reported that nucleoplasmic ARF suppresses MDM2 activity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
However , re-expression of ARF appears to be dominant over AKT mediated control of MDM2 activity ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ We can also assume that AKT promotes MDM2 nuclear localisation , but that its activity is controlled by the AKT mediated NPM-ARF nucleoplasmic pool once there .
Recent studies have reported that the strength of signal originating from oncogene activation is also important in the ARF mediated activation of p53 [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ ARF has been reported to promote p53 stability by sequestering MDM2 to the nucleolus [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , whereas others have reported that nucleoplasmic ARF suppresses MDM2 activity [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Furthermore , growing evidence suggests that AKT activity can mediate p53 stabilization and induction of senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Our results show that the clinical candidate AKT inhibitor MK-2206 promotes ARF nucleolar localization , reduced p53 mut stability and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer .
Our results show that the clinical candidate AKT inhibitor MK-2206 promotes ARF nucleolar localization , reduced p53 mut stability and increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation in a xenograft model of pancreatic cancer .
Inhibition of AKT relieves the p53 mut suppression of p73 .
Inhibition of AKT decreases p53 mut stability in a NPM and ARF dependent manner .
In agreement with this approach tumor cells are often addicted to heat sock proteins ( HSP ) that promote p53 mut stability .
Nucleoplasmic ARF is targeted for degradation by the E3-ligase ULF [ XREF_BIBR ] , therefore manipulation of ULF levels should have the opposite effect on sensitivity to IR .
However , it is the activation of AKT that is proposed to modulate cell death responses to therapeutic agents and mediate resistance [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Furthermore siRNA mediated knockdown of ARF expression similarly increased the sensitivity of T24 cells to IR , indicating that ARF promotes resistance to IR in p53 mut T24 cells .
Conversely , Npm -/- : p53 -/- MEFs transfected with NPM-WT and p53 R248H display increased stability of p53 upon expression Myr-AKT1 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
In agreement with this approach tumor cells are often addicted to heat sock proteins ( HSP ) that promote p53 mut stability .
MDM2 activity is absolutely required for this phenomenon as the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin3A blocks p53 mut turnover which is induced following inhibition of AKT .
To determine whether phospho-S48-NPM affects p53 mut levels in-vivo , we stained serial sections of SQ20B xenografts from mice treated with either DMSO or PI-103 and observed decreased phospho-S48-NPM positivity and reduced levels of p53 mut in PI-103 treated animals ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Further evidence for a role in ARF mediated stabilization of p53 mut came from a study that demonstrated TGF-beta1 induced destabilization of p53 mut by inhibiting E2F-1 mediated transcription of ARF [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Further evidence for a role in ARF mediated stabilization of p53 mut came from a study that demonstrated TGF-beta1 induced destabilization of p53 mut by inhibiting E2F-1 mediated transcription of ARF [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The increased ARF levels following inhibition of AKT are not due to increased transcription as ARF mRNA levels are unchanged following inhibitor treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Our results suggest that AKT contributes to this effect by stabilizing p53 mut protein , however , previous reports indicate that AKT reduces p53 levels via nuclear targeting of MDM2 .
Interestingly , AKT has been demonstrated to increase ARF transcription by relieving BMI1 repression of ARF transcription [ XREF_BIBR ] and therefore provides a potent mechanism to stabilize p53 mut via the elevated transcription and nucleoplasmic localization of ARF .
We also show that ARF promotes p53 mutant stability in tumors and suppresses p73 mediated p21 expression and senescence .
Phosphorylated NPM , but not a NPM-S48A derivative , can be detected with a specific phospho-peptide antibody ( pS48-NPM ) and furthermore , NPM-Ser48 could be phosphorylated by AKT in response to EGF stimulation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ Having established that the phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 by AKT promotes ARF nucleoplasmic localization , MDM2 inhibition and the stabilization of p53 mut , we next wished to address if phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 was a common phenomenon , and potentially contributing to the stabilization of p53 mut in human tumors . ++++ We find that AKT phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 prevents oligomerization that results in nucleoplasmic localization of ARF , constitutive MDM2 inhibition and stabilization of p53 . ++++ AKT phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 regulates NPM oligomerization . ++++ We find that AKT phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 inhibits NPM oligomerisation and localization at the nucleolus . ++++ These results suggest that AKT mediated phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 promotes cellular resistance to IR by promoting ARF relocalization to the nucleoplasm and the stabilization of p53 mut . ++++ Moreover , site directed mutants of NPM that restrict oligomerization also perturb ARF association and nucleolar targeting [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , suggesting that phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 by AKT may also impact ARF localization and stability . ++++ The data presented above argues that phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 by AKT promotes the nucleoplasmic localization of ARF . ++++ Taken together these results suggest that nucleolar localization of both ARF and NPM are disrupted by AKT phosphorylation of NPM-Ser48 , but that a stable pool of NPM persists in oligomeric form .
Furthermore , the transcription of p21 in T24 cells is p73 dependent as siRNA mediated silencing of p73 expression significantly inhibited p21 expression .
Importantly , we find that expression of ARF stabilizes p53 but is now subject to NPM mediated control and AKT inhibition decreases p53 levels .
Interestingly , AKT has been demonstrated to increase ARF transcription by relieving BMI1 repression of ARF transcription [ XREF_BIBR ] and therefore provides a potent mechanism to stabilize p53 mut via the elevated transcription and nucleoplasmic localization of ARF .
The reduction of p53 expression following AKT inhibition is not transcriptionally mediated as the levels of p53 mRNA do not significantly change following inhibitor treatment ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
We confirmed that AKT specifically phosphorylated NPM on Ser48 by in-vitro kinase assay .
Similarly , premature senescence , which was accelerated by galectin-3 depletion in both the cell lines , was rescued by the additional p27 KIP1 inhibition ( XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ Taken together , our data suggest that galectin-3 prevents premature senescence and accelerates gastric tumorigenesis . ++++ Galectin-3 depletion also induces premature senescence in gastric cancer cells . ++++ We demonstrated that galectin-3 depletion caused retarded growth and earlier induction of cellular senescence in galectin-3 -/- MEFs than in galectin-3 +/+ MEFs . ++++ Galectin-3 depletion alone can induce premature senescence in the gastric cancer cells . ++++ To examine whether premature senescence induced by galectin-3 depletion is affected by p53 , we employed two gastric cancer cell lines : AGS ( with WT p53 ) and SNU-601 ( p53 is nonfunctional because of the point mutation R273L ) . ++++ 4 In this study , we demonstrate that galectin-3 inhibits premature senescence and is therefore involved in gastric tumorigenesis . ++++ Thus , galectin-3 appears to inhibit premature senescence through the inhibition of the expression of p27 KIP1 protein . ++++ Taken together , our results show that galectin-3 may accelerate gastric tumorigenesis by inhibiting premature senescence . ++++ There was no difference in the induction of premature senescence based on the p53 status , suggesting that galectin-3 depletion induces senescence in a p27 KIP1 -dependent and p53 independent manner .
Moreover , the depletion of galectin-3 significantly increased the number of G 1 cell cycle arrested cells and the sub-G 1 populations , whereas co-depletion of galectin-3 and p27 KIP1 produced equivalent proliferation to scRNA control group cell populations ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Depletion of galectin-3 induces G1 cell cycle arrest in a p27KIP1 dependent manner . ++++ An increase in the G 1 cell cycle population induced by galectin-3 depletion was also compensated for by Skp2 overexpression ( XREF_FIG ) .
Increased E2F1 luciferase activity by galectin-3 overexpression was reversed by cyclin D1 or CDK4 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Depletion of Skp2 induces premature senescence through an increase in p27 KIP1 protein levels .
Moreover , the depletion of galectin-3 significantly increased the number of G 1 cell cycle arrested cells and the sub-G 1 populations , whereas co-depletion of galectin-3 and p27 KIP1 produced equivalent proliferation to scRNA control group cell populations ( XREF_FIG ) .
Interestingly , PTEN was slightly increased and k-Ras and c-Myc were decreased by galectin-3 depletion , suggesting that tumor suppressors or oncogenic stresses are not involved in galectin-3-induced premature senescence ( XREF_FIG ) .
XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR Inactivation of Skp2 can not induce cellular senescence , but potentiates oncogenic activation and inactivates tumor suppressor gene induced cellular senescence .
Depletion of galectin-3 resulted in growth retardation ( XREF_FIG ) and premature senescence ( XREF_FIG ) in the human foreskin fibroblasts , whereas additional depletion of p27 KIP1 reversed the effect of galectin-3 on these cells .
Increased Skp2 decreases the stability of p27 KIP1 , thereby promoting cell cycle progression and inhibiting premature senescence ( XREF_FIG ) .
Treatment of AGS cells with 10muM galectin-3 siRNA ( Gal3 siRNA ) for 2 days reduced cell proliferation by 50 % ( XREF_FIG ) .
Similarly , premature senescence , which was accelerated by galectin-3 depletion in both the cell lines , was rescued by the additional p27 KIP1 inhibition ( XREF_FIG and XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Interestingly , PTEN was slightly increased and k-Ras and c-Myc were decreased by galectin-3 depletion , suggesting that tumor suppressors or oncogenic stresses are not involved in galectin-3-induced premature senescence ( XREF_FIG ) .

Collectively , these data indicate that , at least in vitro , DBC1 and SIRT1 are not substrates of Chk2 kinase and that the N-terminus of DBC1 inhibits the activity of Chk2 by binding to its kinase domain .
To verify this , we initially set up in vitro kinase assays with recombinant GST-Chk2 and GST-DBC1 as substrate , and although GST-Chk2 was able to autophosphorylate and to target a GST-Cdc25C fragment , used as positive control , GST-DBC1 not only remained unphosphorylated , but quite surprisingly inhibited Chk2 activities .
In spite of this deletion assignment , further studies showed DBC1 overexpression in breast , esophageal , gastric and colorectal cancers and loss of DBC1 increases the death of breast cancer cells ; however , DBC1 inhibits cancer cell survival following genotoxic stress .
The 11S proteasome activator REGgamma binds and activates the catalytic function of the 20S proteasome , promotes the ubiquitin independent degradation of a number of proteins , including SRC-3 , p21 , p16 and p53 and is involved in the regulation of chromosomal stability .

Curiously , when we analyzed the role of DBC1 in Chk2 induced apoptosis , we found that DBC1 depletion does not affect cell death , as previously reported , although it reduces p53 acetylation and PUMA induction , but not PARP1 cleavage . ++++ Active Chk2 thus amplifies the DDR signal and promotes transient cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or , in presence of irreparable damages , the induction of apoptosis . ++++ Since also ectopic Chk2 can promote apoptosis , we verified whether the DBC1 induced cell death might be attributed to an increased Chk2 activity . ++++ Active Chk2 thus amplifies the DDR signal and promotes transient cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair or , in presence of irreparable damages , the induction of apoptosis .
Indeed we found that inactivation of Chk2 reduces DBC1-SIRT1 binding , thus preventing p53 acetylation and DBC1 induced apoptosis . ++++ In summary , we demonstrated that DBC1 promotes apoptosis by SIRT1 inhibition and that this phenomenon is regulated by the ATM-Chk2-REGgamma axis . ++++ Indeed , recently , other papers reported that DBC1 absence , in response to various stimuli , enhances cell death , thus supporting a model in which DBC1 can modulate apoptosis depending on the cellular context , type of damage and on the duration of genotoxic stress .

Curiously , we also found that Chk2 silencing prevents PUMA induction and Caspase-3 cleavage and that Chk2 depletion alone can not affect etoposide induced apoptosis . ++++ Alternatively , we can also suggest the existence of a Chk2 independent way to etoposide induced apoptosis , which does not require caspase-3 cleavage or the induction of PUMA protein .
Since also ectopic Chk2 can promote apoptosis , we verified whether the DBC1 induced cell death might be attributed to an increased Chk2 activity . ++++ Indeed , recently , other papers reported that DBC1 absence , in response to various stimuli , enhances cell death , thus supporting a model in which DBC1 can modulate apoptosis depending on the cellular context , type of damage and on the duration of genotoxic stress .
We found in etoposide treated DBC1 overexpressing cells a marked PUMA accumulation and cleavage of both PARP-1 and Caspase-3 in Chk2-proficient cells , but not in Chk2 deficient cells ( respectively , Figure XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG , compare lanes 5 and 7 and lanes 7 and 8 ) .
Here , we report that the inhibition of SIRT1 by DBC1 in the DNA damage response ( DDR ) also depends on Chk2 , the transducer kinase that is activated by ATM upon DNA lesions and contributes to the spreading of DNA damage signal .

Other in vitro Chk2 kinase assays performed with four DBC1 deletion fragments and full length SIRT1 showed no significant phosphorylation of these recombinant substrates , but they allowed to map the N-terminus sequence ( a.a. 1-229 ) of DBC1 as being responsible for the inhibition of Chk2 autophosphorylation and activity towards Cdc25C .
To verify that this event is not caused by Chk2 dependent induction of SIRT1 protein , possibly mediated by HuR , we performed western blot analysis of control and Chk2 depleted cells expressing ectopic DBC1 , but no significant differences in SIRT1 protein levels were found among samples .

Here , we report that beside ATM and ATR , also Chk2 kinase and REGgamma proteasome activator are required for SIRT1 inhibition by DBC1 and for the induction of DBC1 dependent apoptosis , in response to etoposide induced DNA damage .
However , we did not find any effect of DBC1 ablation on the rate of Chk2 induced cell death .
Curiously , we also found that Chk2 silencing prevents PUMA induction and Caspase-3 cleavage and that Chk2 depletion alone can not affect etoposide induced apoptosis .
Chk2 and REGgamma dependent DBC1 regulation in DNA damage induced apoptosis .
Curiously , when we analyzed the role of DBC1 in Chk2 induced apoptosis , we found that DBC1 depletion does not affect cell death , as previously reported , although it reduces p53 acetylation and PUMA induction , but not PARP1 cleavage . ++++ This route seems to be specifically based on the increase of p53 acetylation by DBC1 dependent SIRT1 inhibition .
Curiously , when we analyzed the role of DBC1 in Chk2 induced apoptosis , we found that DBC1 depletion does not affect cell death , as previously reported , although it reduces p53 acetylation and PUMA induction , but not PARP1 cleavage .
Concordant with these biochemical findings , the increased etoposide induced cell death , due to DBC1 overexpression , was antagonized by Chk2 ablation .
DBC1 mediated repression of SIRT1 results in increased levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53 mediated apoptosis after DNA damage .
Curiously , when we analyzed the role of DBC1 in Chk2 induced apoptosis , we found that DBC1 depletion does not affect cell death , as previously reported , although it reduces p53 acetylation and PUMA induction , but not PARP1 cleavage .
As DBC1 induced p53 acetylation promotes p53 dependent transcriptional activity and apoptosis , we examined the effect of Chk2 depletion on these events . ++++ Indeed , although REGgamma was found not to be implicated in the regulation of SIRT1 activity towards p53 , in our cellular system we demonstrated that REGgamma and its phosphorylation on Ser247 by Chk2 are necessary for the DBC1 dependent increase of p53 acetylation , further corroborating the hypothesis that this proteasome activator subunit could be the missing link between DBC1 and Chk2 toward SIRT1 activity inhibition . ++++ The results showed that the catalytic activity of Chk2 is indispensable for DBC1 mediated induction of p53 acetylation and apoptosis . ++++ DBC1 mediated repression of SIRT1 results in increased levels of p53 acetylation and upregulation of p53 mediated apoptosis after DNA damage .
To determine whether Chk2 also phosphorylates REGgamma in vivo , cell extracts prepared from etoposide treated or untreated samples , with or without the Chk2 inhibitor VRX , were examined with the Phos-tag western blot technique . ++++ Additionally , we found that REGgamma , like Chk2 and DBC1-Thr454 phosphorylation , is required to increase DBC1-SIRT1 binding and SIRT1 activity inhibition and that REGgamma phosphorylation by Chk2 is necessary to increase REGgamma-DBC1 binding in response to DNA damage .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
Similar experiments were performed to determine the role of Thr454 phosphorylation in Chk2 mediated increase of DBC1-SIRT1 association and we found that Chk2 overexpression can not induce the binding of DBC1-T454A to SIRT1 .
It should be noted however that , in cells , deletion of the N-terminus region of DBC1 ( a.a. 1-179 ) is sufficient to abolish DBC1 binding to Chk2 which maps on Chk2 catalytic domain .
Upon DNA damage , DBC1 is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR on Thr454 and this modification increases its inhibitory interaction with SIRT1 , leading to p53 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis .
Upon DNA damage , DBC1 is phosphorylated by ATM and ATR on Thr454 and this modification increases its inhibitory interaction with SIRT1 , leading to p53 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis .
Other in vitro Chk2 kinase assays performed with four DBC1 deletion fragments and full length SIRT1 showed no significant phosphorylation of these recombinant substrates , but they allowed to map the N-terminus sequence ( a.a. 1-229 ) of DBC1 as being responsible for the inhibition of Chk2 autophosphorylation and activity towards Cdc25C .
Moreover , DBC1-SIRT1 binding is negatively regulated by hMOF acetylation ( a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases ) of specific DBC1 residues , a process inhibited by ATM upon DNA damage .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
These events are mediated by Chk2 phosphorylation of the 11S proteasome activator REGgamma on Ser247 , which increases REGgamma-DBC1 interaction and SIRT1 inhibition .
Although DBC1 and SIRT1 protein levels were similar in all cell extracts , we found that etoposide treatment increased the amount of SIRT1 that co-immunoprecipitated with DBC1 , as already reported , but no increase was seen in Chk2 silenced cells .
Following DNA damage , ATM phosphorylates Chk2 on Thr68 , leading to its activation and phosphorylation of several substrates , including p53 , HDMX , PML , TRF2 and KAP1 .
Altogether , these findings suggest that Chk2 kinase promotes the physical association between DBC1 and SIRT1 in DNA damaged cells and , for this , the phosphorylation of DBC1 on Thr454 by ATM and ATR is also required .
However , although we noticed in Chk2 depleted cells reduced level of both PUMA protein and cleaved caspase-3 , as previously reported in , we curiously found that Chk2 depletion or chemical inhibition has no effect on etoposide induced p53 acetylation and apoptosis , as demonstrated by cleaved PARP1 levels and by the percentage of dead cells .
The potential role played by REGgamma in DBC1 dependent inhibition of SIRT1 was analyzed in DBC1 overexpressing U2OS cells transfected with siRNA against REGgamma or a control sequence , and the results showed that REGgamma depletion reduces the DBC1 dependent increase in p53 acetylation .
Moreover , when we overexpressed REGgamma WT or REGgamma S247A in control or Chk2 silenced U2OS cells , we detected an increase in p53 acetylation , upon etoposide , only with the ectopic wild-type protein and in Chk2 proficient cells , clearly indicating that SIRT1 inhibition by DBC1 requires REGgamma phosphorylated on S247 by Chk2 .
These results suggest that REGgamma-Ser247 phosphorylation by Chk2 can induce a conformational change in REGgamma protein that favors its binding to DBC1 .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
These events are mediated by Chk2 phosphorylation of the 11S proteasome activator REGgamma on Ser247 , which increases REGgamma-DBC1 interaction and SIRT1 inhibition .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
Although in unstressed cells neither DBC1 overexpression nor Chk2 depletion affected p53 acetylation ( data not shown ) , in etoposide treated cells DBC1 overexpression raised p53 acetylation in Chk2-proficient , but not in Chk2 depleted cells .
Together , these results indicate that DBC1 and REGgamma interact in human cells and that Chk2 can phosphorylate a fraction of the total pool of REGgamma in human cells on Ser 247 .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
In accordance with this , we found that , upon DNA damage Chk2 phosphorylates REGgamma on Ser247 , both in vitro and in vivo , and that this modification promotes p53 acetylation , PUMA protein induction and apoptosis .
Thus , according to our model , following DNA damage ATM phosphorylates p53-S15 , DBC1-T454 and Chk2-T68 , inducing p53 stabilization , DBC1-SIRT1 binding and Chk2 activation and phosphorylation of REGgamma-Ser247 .
Rapamycin has also been reported to differentially regulate S6K1 in comparison with 4E-BP1 in various cell lines including HeLa , MEFs , and HEK293 , where rapamycin initially decreased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but this decrease recovered within 6h while S6K1 phosphorylation continued to be inhibited and by 12h after treatment since 4E-BP1 was mostly hyperphosphorylated , it dissociated from eIF4E leading to a recovery in cap dependent translation even though S6K1 inhibition by rapamycin continued [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ More recently , we have reported that these phosphorylations might be coordinate instead of being sequential and the loss of these HM and AL phosphorylations is consequential and not because of inhibition of S6K1 by rapamycin [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Rapamycin resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 has been reported in regenerating rat livers where rapamycin inhibits activation of S6K1 in response to partial hepatectomy , but 4E-BP1 phosphorylation remains uninhibited , suggesting that the effect of rapamycin on 4E-BP1 function in vivo can be significantly different from its effect in cultured cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
These studies with Torin suggest that rapamycin resistance of mTORC1 might be a general feature of a good number of mammalian systems [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Rapamycin inhibits the mTORC1 activity since rapamycin bound to FKBP12 interacts with either free mTOR or mTOR in the mTORC1 complex causing conformational changes in mTORC1 which are responsible for rapamycin 's effect on mTORC1 targets [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Deptor and mLST8 are components of both mTOR complexes and whereas deptor negatively regulates mTORC1 as well as mTORC2 , mLST8 is essential only for mTORC2 function [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Rheb activates mTORC1 but inhibits mTORC2 while TSC1/2 inhibits Rheb and mTORC1 but activates mTORC2 most likely by overcoming the negative feedback loop [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Also the phosphorylation of these sites is rather insensitive to rapamycin which could suggest that these phosphorylations are possibly mTOR independent however since these phosphorylations are inhibited by amino acids starvation of cells and by mTOR kinase inhibitors like wortmannin , activated by Rheb ( an mTOR activator ) , and are decreased in mTOR knockdown cells which suggests that the phosphorylation of these N-terminal residues is mediated by mTOR but through a raptor independent mechanism [ XREF_BIBR ] .
PI-103 and NVP-BEZ235 have been found to suppress AKT as well as S6K1 in breast tumors and leukemia cells [ XREF_BIBR ] , although some studies suggest that such broad inhibition of cellular signalling may also impair growth of normal cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The phosphorylation status of raptor governs mTORC1 activity since phosphorylation of raptor on S722/792 by 5 ' AMP activated kinase ( AMPK ) inhibits mTORC1 whereas mTOR mediated phosphorylation of raptor on S863 is crucial for the activation of mTORC1 in response to mitogen stimulation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

S6K1 inactivates eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase ( eEF2K ) which is a negative regulator of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) , by phosphorylating it at S366 , and thus regulates the elongation step of translation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Upon activation by growth factors , PI3K phosphorylates the D3 position of phosphatidylinositols producing the second messenger PtdIns ( 3,4,5 ) P3 that binds to the pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain of AKT and translocates this kinase to the plasma membrane where it gets activated by upstream kinases [ XREF_BIBR ] .
mTOR inhibitors can be broadly grouped into two classes : the allosteric inhibitors of mTORC1 ( rapamycin and rapalogs ) and the mTOR kinase inhibitors .
Significant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at T37 and T46 and S65 is still observed in mTORC2 deficient Sin-1 knockout MEFs when treated with rapamycin , even though the hydrophobic motifs of both AKT and S6K1 are not phosphorylated due to absence of mTOR activity in both of its complexes .

Rheb activates mTORC1 but inhibits mTORC2 while TSC1/2 inhibits Rheb and mTORC1 but activates mTORC2 most likely by overcoming the negative feedback loop [ XREF_BIBR ] .
This mTOR activation causes an increase in ribosome biogenesis that promotes cell proliferation by providing the machinery which is required by cells to maintain high levels of growth [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The activation of the tumour suppressor protein p53 induces a proteasome mediated specific cleavage of 4E-BP1 that gives rise to an N-terminally truncated , completely unphosphorylated and more stable form of 4E-BP1 that interacts with eIF4E in preference to full-length 4E-BP1 , which results in long-term unavailability of eIF4E , thereby contributing to the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of p53 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Dysregulated expression as well as increased phosphorylation of 4E-BPs in cancer also results in poor patient prognosis and the loss of 4E-BP1 with the resulting activation of cap dependent translation promotes cell-cycle progression and cell proliferation in culture [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] whereas overexpression of constitutively active 4E-BP1 suppresses tumor growth in vivo [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

mTORC1 phosphorylates 4E-BP1 at several residues which promotes the dissociation of eIF4E from 4E-BP1 consequently mitigating the inhibitory effect of 4E-BP1 on eIF4E dependent translation initiation whereas the inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin is believed to cause 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation , which results in inhibition of protein translation ( XREF_FIG ) [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Lipin-1 lowers SREBP1/2 levels inside the nucleus and mTORC1 mediated phosphorylation of Lipin-1 prevents it from entering the nucleus , thus suppressing this inhibition [ XREF_BIBR ] .
It is possible that rapamycin does not inhibit mTORC1 dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 completely .
In AML , for example , the phosphorylation of S6K1 on T389 is abrogated by RAD001 while phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 on S65 residue remains unaffected , thus failing to inhibit mRNA translation and the assembly of eIF4F complexes [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Rapamycin has also been reported to differentially regulate S6K1 in comparison with 4E-BP1 in various cell lines including HeLa , MEFs , and HEK293 , where rapamycin initially decreased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation but this decrease recovered within 6h while S6K1 phosphorylation continued to be inhibited and by 12h after treatment since 4E-BP1 was mostly hyperphosphorylated , it dissociated from eIF4E leading to a recovery in cap dependent translation even though S6K1 inhibition by rapamycin continued [ XREF_BIBR ] .

The C-terminal region of S6K1 has an RSPRR motif which is important for the inhibitory role of this region , because a negative regulator of S6K1 binds to this motif [ XREF_BIBR ] and a deletion mutant of S6K1 lacking the C-terminal region is phosphorylated by mTORC2 [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ These molecules inhibit mTORC1 , mTORC2 , and PI3K , thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT , S6K1 , and 4E-BP1 , and are therefore attractive drugs for targeting cancers driven by PI3K activation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Rapamycin resistant phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 has been reported in regenerating rat livers where rapamycin inhibits activation of S6K1 in response to partial hepatectomy , but 4E-BP1 phosphorylation remains uninhibited , suggesting that the effect of rapamycin on 4E-BP1 function in vivo can be significantly different from its effect in cultured cells [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Whether this Pim-2 kinase dependent and rapamycin insensitive phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is carried out by a rapamycin insensitive mTORC1 complex or somehow by the mTORC2 complex is not known [ XREF_BIBR ] .

eIF4E is phosphorylated at S209 by mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) interacting protein kinase Mnk1/2 which uses a docking site in the carboxy-terminus of eIF4G to phosphorylate eIF4E , thus making it certain that eIF4E is phosphorylated only after the assembly of the eIF4F complex [ XREF_BIBR ] .
S6K1 also phosphorylates the p53 ubiquitin ligase , Mdm2 , on S166 [ XREF_BIBR ] and proapoptotic protein BAD , thus regulating cell survival [ XREF_BIBR ] .

In response to growth factors , AKT directly phosphorylates TSC2 on several distinct residues [ XREF_BIBR ] that prevents the formation of TSC1 and TSC2 complex , thus allowing GTPase Rheb to convert back into the GTP bound active state [ XREF_BIBR ] which leads to mTORC1 activation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Also it is not clear whether the rapamycin sensitive sites of 4E-BP1 are directly phosphorylated by mTOR in vivo ; moreover some studies suggest that another unidentified 4E-BP1 kinase might exist [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The phosphorylation status of raptor governs mTORC1 activity since phosphorylation of raptor on S722/792 by 5 ' AMP activated kinase ( AMPK ) inhibits mTORC1 whereas mTOR mediated phosphorylation of raptor on S863 is crucial for the activation of mTORC1 in response to mitogen stimulation [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
The mTORC2 substrate GSK3 ( glycogen synthase kinase 3 ) connects AKT to lipid synthesis since GSK phosphorylates lipogenic transcription factor SREBP ( sterol responsive element binding protein ) and targets it for protein degradation which is opposed by AKT mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of GSK .
These molecules inhibit mTORC1 , mTORC2 , and PI3K , thus inhibiting the phosphorylation of AKT , S6K1 , and 4E-BP1 , and are therefore attractive drugs for targeting cancers driven by PI3K activation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4B ( eIF4B ) is also phosphorylated by S6K1 and this phosphorylation promotes the recruitment of eIF4B to eukaryotic initiation factor 4A ( eIF4A ) at the translation initiation complex where it functions as a cofactor of eIF4A and increases its processivity [ XREF_BIBR ] .

To determine how p27 inhibits ERK activation in arsenite response , the activation of upstream kinases , the Raf and MEK cascade , was compared between p27 +/+ and p27-/- cells .
As shown in XREF_FIG , phosphorylations of c-Raf at S289/296/301 and S338 , the central points for controlling Raf activation , were found substantially upregulated by arsenite in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells compared with those in p27 +/+ cells .
Subsequently , we used rapamycin to interfere with mTORC1 activity and found that it reduced HIF-1alpha induction in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that p27 inhibited HIF-1alpha translation .
Further functional studies demonstrated that through inhibiting S6 mediated hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha ( HIF-1alpha ) translation , p27 contributed to the protection from environmental carcinogen ( sodium arsenite )-induced cell transformation .
To investigate whether arsenite could affect HIF-1alpha protein translation and whether inhibition of Raf/ERK/S6 pathway by p27 would attenuate it , we first checked HIF-1alpha induction by arsenite in p27 +/+ and p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells .
In addition , we performed Ras activity assay and found that in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells Ras was kept in constitutively activated GTP bound form ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that p27 might target Ras for deactivation of the downstream kinases .
In line with this , HIF-1alpha protein synthesis detected by pulse labeling assay was markedly repressed by the introduction of HA-S6 S235/236A in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that p27 inhibited HIF-1alpha translation in an S6-phosphorylation-dependent manner in arsenite response .
48 In our current studies , we investigated the role of p27 in arsenite induced protein translation and its biological significance , as well as the underlying mechanisms .
The findings were further reproduced in shRNA p27 transfectants of both MEFs and Cl41 cells ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that arsenite induced activation of p70S6K was upregulated upon p27 depletion .
In line with this , HIF-1alpha protein synthesis detected by pulse labeling assay was markedly repressed by the introduction of HA-S6 S235/236A in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that p27 inhibited HIF-1alpha translation in an S6-phosphorylation-dependent manner in arsenite response .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the expression of full-length p27 was able to completely abrogate induction of phospho-S6 by arsenite , whereas transfection of C terminus of p27 ( aa 78-198 ) did not render the repressive effect , indicating that the N terminus of p27 ( aa 1-51 ) was critical for its inhibitory effect on S6 phosphorylation induced by arsenite .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the incorporation of 35 S-methionine and cysteine into newly synthesized HIF-1alpha protein was gradually increased along with the isotope incubation time in both p27 +/+ and p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells .
In our current studies , we found that arsenite induced phospho-AKT S473 was elevated in p27-/- cells and shRNA p27 transfectants when compared with that in wild-type and nonsense control cells , respectively ( XREF_FIG ) .
48 In our current studies , we investigated the role of p27 in arsenite induced protein translation and its biological significance , as well as the underlying mechanisms .
To show explicitly the role of S6 phosphorylation in HIF-1alpha protein translation under the control of the p27 signaling in arsenite response , we introduced S6 S235/236A double mutant , which specifically abolished phosphorylation of Ser235/236 in endogenous S6 .
More importantly , knockdown of HIF-1alpha efficiently reversed cell transformation of shRNA p27 cells ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting that it might be through regulating HIF-1alpha protein expression that p27 achieved its inhibitory effect in arsenite induced cell transformation .
Thus , the results demonstrated that by deactivating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK/p90RSK pathway , p27 inhibited arsenite induced S6 phosphorylation . ++++ Using these cells , we found that arsenite treatment caused a strong induction of phospho-S6 at S235/236 in p27-/- cells compared with that in p27 +/+ cells at all the time points tested ( 3-12h ) , regardless of the knockout methods used ( XREF_FIG , bottom panels ) , indicating that p27 might abrogate arsenite induced S6 phosphorylation at S235/236 .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the basal level of PHLPP was depleted in p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells , and arsenite treatment decreased PHLPP1 expression in p27 +/+ cells .
Consistently , stable transfection of another dominant mutant form of AKT , T308 and S473A , into p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells ( XREF_FIG ) was not able to decrease S6 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ) , but it could partially reduce phosphorylation of GSK3beta at S9 , a well-known downstream target of AKT ( XREF_FIG ) .
As shown in XREF_FIG ( lower panels ) , in both p70S6K-knockdown transfectants arsenite induced phosphorylation of p70S6K was apparently reduced but not that of S6 , indicating that p70S6K was not the upstream kinase that was responsible for the elevated S6 phosphorylation in p27 depleted cells in response to arsenite .
Although PI3K and AKT pathway was also involved in S6 activation , blocking AKT and p70S6K activation did not attenuate arsenite induced S6 activation in p27-/- cells , suggesting p27 specifically targeted Ras and ERK pathway rather than PI3K and AKT pathway for inhibition of S6 activation in response to arsenite exposure .
Therefore , we came to our final conclusion , as delineated in XREF_FIG , that by maintaining PHLPP expression , p27 blocked the activation of oncogenic Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway in response to both acute and chronic arsenite exposure , led to inhibition of S6 activation in a p90RSK dependent manner and consequently attenuated protein translation of HIF-1alpha , a key transcription factor involved in chronic arsenite induced cell transformation .
AKT and p70S6K pathway was not responsible for hyperphosphorylation of S6 caused by p27 depletion .
Consistently , stable transfection of another dominant mutant form of AKT , T308 and S473A , into p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells ( XREF_FIG ) was not able to decrease S6 phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG ) , but it could partially reduce phosphorylation of GSK3beta at S9 , a well-known downstream target of AKT ( XREF_FIG ) .
Elevations of phospho-S6 at S235/236 were also observed in the stable transfectants of shRNA p27 generated from MEFs of different backgrounds and gestational ages , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ( XREF_FIG ) as well as from mouse epidermal Cl41 cells ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that the inhibitory effect of p27 on arsenite induced S6 phosphorylation at S235/236 was prevalent , which was neither cell type specific nor developmental stage dependent .
P27 inhibited arsenite induced ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation .
Our findings showed that depletion of p27 expression by knockout and knockdown approaches efficiently enhanced S6 phosphorylation in arsenite response via overactivating Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway , which consequently resulted in the stimulation of p90RSK ( 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase ) , a direct kinase for S6 phosphorylation .
18 As shown in XREF_FIG , ectopic expression of HA-S6 S235/236A in p27-/- ( Delta51 ) cells efficiently attenuated arsenite induced HIF-1alpha upregulation .
As shown in XREF_FIG , upregulation of ERK/S6 phosphorylation and HIF-1alpha induction by arsenite were observed in shRNA p27 transfectants as compared with those in control transfectants . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG , upregulation of ERK/S6 phosphorylation and HIF-1alpha induction by arsenite were observed in shRNA p27 transfectants as compared with those in control transfectants .

MEK and ERK pathway is known as the upstream activators responsible for p90RSK mediated S6 phosphorylation , 1 thus in turn we checked ERK activation as well as the other two kinases of MAPK family .
In contrast , blockage of Ras/Raf/MER/ERK pathway by transfecting dominant negative Ras ( S17N ) and ERK1/2 ( K71/52R ) into p27-/-( Delta51 ) cells attenuated S6 phosphorylation , suggesting that p27 negatively controlled S6 activation by inhibiting the Ras/Raf/MER/ERK/p90RSK pathway .
XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR It has been demonstrated that the hypoxia signaling pathway is affected by exposure to arsenic , and chronic exposure to low-dose arsenite induced HIF-1alpha protein expression , which contributed to tumor angiogenesis .
As shown in XREF_FIG , the phosphorylations of p70S6K on T421 and S424 induced by arsenite were elevated in p27-/- cells compared with those in p27 +/+ cells at all the time points examined in both pairs of knockout cells .
On the other hand , it reduced the accumulation of LC3-II caused by bafilomycin A1 , recapitulating the effect of U0126 on the autophagy flux in both IgR3 and Mel-RM cells , and the effect of PLX4720 in IgR3 cells .
Furthermore , the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited cell death at relatively early stages after withdrawal of serum [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Noticeably , PLX4720 decreased CREB activation ( phosphorylation ) in BRAF V600E melanoma cells .
To confirm that downregulation of Noxa by PLX4720 in BRAF V600E melanoma cells is due to inhibition of the MEK and ERK pathway , we treated IgR3 and MM200 ( BRAF V600E ) , and Mel-RM and ME4405 ( BRAF WT ) cells with the MEK inhibitor U0126 .
Inhibition of oncogenic BRAF V600E or MEK downregulated Noxa , whereas activation of MEK and ERK caused its upregulation .
U0126 abolished bafilomycin A1 triggered accumulation of LC3-II in both cell lines .
In line with this , knockdown of ERK1/2 with siRNA similarly caused downregulation of Noxa in both BRAF V600E and BRAF WT melanoma cells .
However , knockdown of Noxa enhanced proliferation of melanoma cells cultured under nutrient ( serum )-sufficient conditions .
Binding of Bcl-2 , Bcl-X L , or Mcl-1 with beclin-1 interferes with the association of beclin-1 with PIK3C3 and hVps34 thus inhibiting its autophagy inducing potential [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Knockdown of Noxa inhibited activation of autophagy in melanoma cells under serum starvation conditions as shown by reduced LC3-II and elevated p62 levels .
Pro survival Bcl-2 family proteins negatively regulate autophagy by binding to beclin-1 , which plays an important role in autophagosome formation through forming complexes with Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 ( PIK3C3 )/mammalian vacuolar protein sorting 34 homologue ( hVps34 ) that is a nutrient regulated lipid kinase [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

In support , ectopic expression of BRAF V600E in Mel-RM cells increased accumulation of LC3-II induced by bafilomycin A1 . ++++ Similarly , PLX4720 inhibited the increase in LC3-II induced by bafilomycin A1 in IgR3 cells . ++++ U0126 abolished bafilomycin A1 triggered accumulation of LC3-II in both cell lines . ++++ On the other hand , it reduced the accumulation of LC3-II caused by bafilomycin A1 , recapitulating the effect of U0126 on the autophagy flux in both IgR3 and Mel-RM cells , and the effect of PLX4720 in IgR3 cells .
Since Mcl-1 that can bind to and inhibit Noxa is also increased with melanoma progression [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , and the ability of Noxa to trigger apoptosis is determined by a balance between its expression levels and the levels of Mcl-1 [ XREF_BIBR ] , it seems that high expression of Mcl-1 is sufficient to enable melanoma cells to withstand similarly high levels of Noxa . ++++ Since Mcl-1 that can bind to and inhibit Noxa is also increased with melanoma progression [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , and the ability of Noxa to trigger apoptosis is determined by a balance between its expression levels and the levels of Mcl-1 [ XREF_BIBR ] , it seems that high expression of Mcl-1 is sufficient to enable melanoma cells to withstand similarly high levels of Noxa .
However , we have found that the expression of the other BH3-only protein Noxa is commonly upregulated in melanoma cells , and that this is driven by oncogenic activation of MEK and ERK . ++++ In this report , we present evidence that the BH3-only protein Noxa is upregulated by oncogenic activation of MEK and ERK signaling , and that Noxa plays an important role in regulation of autophagy in melanoma cells .
In addition , we demonstrate that Noxa is necessary for induction of autophagy that delays apoptosis in melanoma cells under nutrient starvation conditions . ++++ It is conceivable that Noxa may similarly activate autophagy triggered by oncogenic activation of MEK and ERK through displacement of Mcl-1 from beclin-1 , and that a dynamic balance between the Mcl-1 and Noxa and Mcl-1 and beclin-1 complexes contributes to regulation of autophagy and apoptosis in melanoma cells , in particular , when cells are under stress conditions such as nutrient starvation .

Similarly , introduction of exogenous BRAF V600E into BRAF WT melanoma cells ( Mel-RM ) also resulted in upregulation of Noxa in association with activation of ERK . ++++ Inhibition of oncogenic BRAF V600E or MEK downregulated Noxa , whereas activation of MEK and ERK caused its upregulation .
However , it was increased by PLX4720 in Mel-RM and ME4405 cells that harboured wild-type BRAF ( BRAF WT ) . ++++ In support , the Noxa protein levels in BRAF V600E melanoma cells treated with PLX4720 in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 remained significantly lower compared to those without exposure to the BRAF inhibitor [ XREF_BIBR ] .
p53 independent induction of Noxa by CREB has also been previously reported [ XREF_BIBR ] .
These results suggest that activation of autophagy mediated by Noxa delays apoptosis in melanoma cells induced by serum starvation .
p53 independent induction of Noxa by CREB has also been previously reported [ XREF_BIBR ] .
This is conceivably caused by reduction in autophagy activity resulting from deficiency in Noxa that causes accumulation of p62 , thus leading to increased melanoma cell proliferation , as autophagy deficiency has been recently reported to promote cell proliferation through p62 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Moreover , deletion of CREB binding site did not cause any further reduction in the transcriptional activity of the Noxa promoter in BRAF V600E IgR3 and BRAF WT Mel-RM cells treated with U0126 .
Inhibition of Noxa resulted in increases in melanoma cell proliferation as shown in 5-bromo-2 '-deoxyuridine ( BrdU ) incorporation and clonogenic assays , suggesting that Noxa negatively regulates melanoma cell proliferation .
Furthermore , knockdown of Noxa blocked accumulation of LC3-II in Mel-RM cells triggered by bafilomycin A1 in the presence of PLX4720 .
Since Noxa is downregulated by BRAF inhibitors in mutant BRAF melanoma cells [ XREF_BIBR ] , we tested whether activation of MEK and ERK signaling is essential for constitutive expression of Noxa in the cells .
Consistent with our finding that MEK and ERK signaling also enhances activation of CREB , a recent study has demonstrated by analysis of biopsies from BRAF V600E melanoma patients that activation of CREB was supressed by inhibition of mutant BRAF or MEK but restored in relapsing melanomas [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Of note , Noxa knockdown accelerated reduction in cell viability caused by serum starvation , which was largely due to induction of apoptosis as shown by caspase-3 activation and cleavage of its substrate PARP .

Moreover , deletion of CREB binding site did not cause any further reduction in the transcriptional activity of the Noxa promoter in BRAF V600E IgR3 and BRAF WT Mel-RM cells treated with U0126 .
Activation of BH3-only proteins are essential in induction of apoptosis as they act as intracellular " death ligands " to activate Bax and Bak leading to mitochondrion damage by displacing them from pro survival Bcl-2 family members [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
In support , the Noxa protein levels in BRAF V600E melanoma cells treated with PLX4720 in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 remained significantly lower compared to those without exposure to the BRAF inhibitor [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Indeed , Noxa is responsible for oncogenic RAS induced autophagy through displacing Mcl-1 from beclin-1 in other types of cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Moreover , deletion of CREB binding site did not cause any further reduction in the transcriptional activity of the Noxa promoter in BRAF V600E IgR3 and BRAF WT Mel-RM cells treated with U0126 .
Moreover , deletion of CREB binding site did not cause any further reduction in the transcriptional activity of the Noxa promoter in BRAF V600E IgR3 and BRAF WT Mel-RM cells treated with U0126 .

Deletion of the CREB binding site , but not deletion of the binding site for p53 or E2F1 , markedly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the Noxa promoter in Mel-RM and ME4405 cells with or without co-introduction of BRAF V600E .
However , excessive or prolonged autophagy leads to cell death [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

Regulation of Noxa expression by PLX4720 appeared to be mediated by a transcriptional mechanism , in that the addition of actinomycin D abolished the increase in the Noxa transcript in Mel-RM and ME4405 cells treated with the inhibitor .
Indeed , in ES cells , the G1 checkpoint is absent ; accordingly , in these cells , CHK2 was unable to induce Cdc25A degradation .

Further , a recent study reports misregulated kinase signaling in AC and demonstrates that a kinase inhibitor of Wnt signaling , one of whose targets is GSK3 , reverses AC phenotypes in zebrafish .
Protein methylation has only recently begun to be appreciated as a regulator of cytoplasmic signal transduction in the initiation of signaling from cell surface receptors ( BMP induced Smad signaling ) and Wnt signaling .
Calculation of the Pearson 's correlation coefficient indicated that DP-IF colocalization in the cytoplasm increased approximately twofold in response to GSK3 inhibition , raising the possibility that GSK3 is required to promote the normal assembly of DP into desmosomes .

Glycogen synthase kinase 3 ( GSK3 ) signaling modulates DP-IF complexes .
Whether genetic mutations of DP promote the pathogenesis of AC through the loss of structural integrity of cardiac tissues or misregulated signaling is not well understood .
These data indicate that GSK3 plays a specific and independent role in mediating DP dynamics that can not be rescued by PKC .
These data support in vitro observations that R2834H DP decreases phosphorylation of DP compared with WT .

The inhibition of HK II function can slow down the aerobic glycolysis and increase OXPHOS activity which is required to increase tumor cell survival under genotoxic stress conditions .
By blocking the interaction between HK II and MnSOD , mTOR enables the proper activation of MnSOD , which is required to scavenge elevated ROS resulting from enhanced OXPHOS .
HK II is highly activated in cancer cells and is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria where it phosphorylates glucose in the first step of glycolysis [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ HK II is in the first step of aerobic glycolysis ; it is located on the outer membrane of mitochondria and phosphorylates glucose to glucose-6-phosphate .

Key regulators of the DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest include Chk1 , Chk2 and p53 proteins [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ mTOR is required for efficient DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest . ++++ Taken together , these results show that mTOR is required for efficient DNA damage induced S and G2/M cell cycle arrest . ++++ In conclusion , these results show that mTOR is required for efficient DNA damage induced cell cycle arrest , and this is possibly mediated by regulation of key cell cycle proteins Chk1 , Chk2 and p53 . ++++ Inactivation of mTOR , with siRNA or an mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor , prevented DNA damage induced S and G2/M cell cycle arrest as well as Chk1 activation , demonstrating a requirement of mTOR for cell survival by establishing efficient cell cycle arrest .
In this study we investigated how mTOR signals to the cell machinery to promote cell survival following DNA damage . ++++ As mTOR is a key regulator of the cell cycle [ XREF_BIBR ] , we next assessed whether mTOR enhanced cell survival in response to DNA damage by promoting cell cycle arrest . ++++ The mechanism by which mTOR promotes cell survival under conditions of DNA damage is poorly understood . ++++ As mTOR is a key regulator of cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase [ XREF_BIBR ] , we investigated whether mTOR promotes cell survival following DNA damage by regulating cell cycle arrest , which would consequently allow more time for DNA repair .
However , the etoposide mediated increase in mTOR protein accumulation was still observed in both p53 +/+ and p53 -/- HCT116 cells in the presence of cycloheximide , indicating that etoposide mediated increase in mTOR was unlikely due to increased protein synthesis . ++++ We were interested in the role of p53 in etoposide induced increase of mTOR and therefore assessed isogenically matched p53 +/+ and p53 -/- HCT116 cells . ++++ However , the etoposide mediated increase in mTOR protein accumulation was still observed in both p53 +/+ and p53 -/- HCT116 cells in the presence of cycloheximide , indicating that etoposide mediated increase in mTOR was unlikely due to increased protein synthesis . ++++ mTOR is induced by etoposide in an ATM and ATR dependent , and p53 independent manner .
We were interested in the role of p53 in etoposide induced increase of mTOR and therefore assessed isogenically matched p53 +/+ and p53 -/- HCT116 cells . ++++ mTOR is induced by etoposide in an ATM and ATR dependent , and p53 independent manner . ++++ A number of reports have described p53 mediated down regulation of mTOR signalling [ XREF_BIBR ] .
mTOR inhibition with PP242 following DNA damage did not further increase Chk1 turnover , therefore it is unlikely that the decrease in Chk1 caused by mTOR inhibition is due to an increase in Chk1 degradation . ++++ Nevertheless , total Chk1 is still reduced by mTOR inhibition following etoposide induced DNA damage . ++++ However , in the presence of cycloheximide Chk1 level is efficiently suppressed before and after DNA damage , more importantly PP242 did not cause a further reduction in Chk1 implying that Chk1 reduction caused by mTOR inhibition is mediated by preventing its synthesis at translation level .
Our work is the first to link mTORC2 to Chk1 regulation in DNA damage response signalling to promote cell survival . ++++ The central role of the DNA damage response is to enhance cell survival .
In order to explore the mechanism of etoposide induced increase in mTOR protein level , HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 -/- cells were either treated with cycloheximide , an inhibitor of protein synthesis , or the proteasome inhibitor , MG-132 . ++++ In order to explore the mechanism of etoposide induced increase in mTOR protein level , HCT116 p53 +/+ and p53 -/- cells were either treated with cycloheximide , an inhibitor of protein synthesis , or the proteasome inhibitor , MG-132 .
Western blot analysis revealed that etoposide induced increase in phosphorylation and total protein level of Chk1 , and p53 were reduced by pharmacological inhibition of mTOR kinase at 4 and 24 hrs . ++++ mTOR dependent induction of p53 after DNA damage has previously been reported [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and as HEK293 cells used here are known to have non functional p53 [ XREF_BIBR ] , we further assessed mTOR dependent regulation of Chk1 and Chk2 after DNA damage .
Instead these data suggested a requirement of mTORC2 for etoposide induced Chk1 activation as siRNA against Raptor ( selective downregulation of mTORC1 ) did not affect Chk1 , whereas siRNA against Rictor ( selective downregulation of mTORC2 ) did prevent etoposide induced Chk1 phosphorylation and total Chk1 protein level . ++++ mTORC2 complex is required for etoposide induced activation of Chk1 .
As mTOR is a key regulator of the cell cycle [ XREF_BIBR ] , we next assessed whether mTOR enhanced cell survival in response to DNA damage by promoting cell cycle arrest . ++++ mTOR regulation in response to etoposide induced DNA damage .
mTOR is induced by etoposide in an ATM and ATR dependent , and p53 independent manner .
While there is evidence that DNA damage eventually leads to mTORC1 inhibition through p53 dependent mechanisms [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , there are also an increasing number of reports demonstrating that mTORC1 positively regulates p53 , [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] and that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 pathways are activated following DNA damage [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
As mTOR is a key regulator of the cell cycle [ XREF_BIBR ] , we next assessed whether mTOR enhanced cell survival in response to DNA damage by promoting cell cycle arrest .
We show that inactivation of mTOR with siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1/2 kinase prevents etoposide induced S and G2/M cell cycle arrest .
We show that inactivation of mTOR with siRNA or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1/2 kinase prevents etoposide induced S and G2/M cell cycle arrest .
These results are consistent with a previous report demonstrating a requirement of ATM for the initial transient increase in protein synthesis induced by DNA damage that was mediated by mTORC1 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Taken together , our results show that etoposide induced increase in mTOR is independent of p53 , but dependent on ATM and ATR activity .
mTOR is induced by etoposide in an ATM and ATR dependent , and p53 independent manner .
mTOR regulates Chk1 production following etoposide induced DNA damage .
Consistent with our previous results , western blot analysis revealed that etoposide induced Chk1 phosphorylation was strikingly inhibited by PP242 in all breast cell lines tested . ++++ Furthermore , in other breast cancer cell lines ( HBL100 , MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 ) , PP242 and mTOR siRNA treatment in HBL100 cells inhibited all three Chk1 phosphorylations induced by etoposide .
In line with this , recent work has demonstrated that cisplatin induced apoptosis was significantly increased by loss of Rictor but not Raptor in breast and ovarian cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Consequently , in cells that undergo DNA damage induced p53 dependent cell death , mTOR ablation could prevent p53 mediated cell death .
Collectively , these results demonstrate that inhibition of mTOR activity significantly potentiates etoposide mediated cell death in breast cancer , suggesting that breast cancer cells may rely on the mTORC2-Chk1 pathway for survival .
Since we observed that PP242 inhibited Chk1 phosphorylation at Ser345 , this could account for why Chk1 degradation is prevented .
PP242 inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes , therefore in order to dissect out the contribution of mTORC1 and/or mTORC2 to DNA damage mediated Chk1 regulation we used rapamycin , which predominantly inhibits mTORC1 , as well as specific downregulation of Raptor and Rictor with siRNA .
Consistent with our previous results , western blot analysis revealed that etoposide induced Chk1 phosphorylation was strikingly inhibited by PP242 in all breast cell lines tested .
To confirm that the effects we observed were specific to mTOR , we downregulated mTOR with siRNA and found that etoposide induced phosphorylation of Chk1 and Chk2 were reduced as well as total Chk1 level .
Furthermore , in other breast cancer cell lines ( HBL100 , MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 ) , PP242 and mTOR siRNA treatment in HBL100 cells inhibited all three Chk1 phosphorylations induced by etoposide .
Numerous studies have demonstrated that Chk1 inhibition following DNA damage potentiates DNA damage induced cell death via multiple mechanisms [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Furthermore , in other breast cancer cell lines ( HBL100 , MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 ) , PP242 and mTOR siRNA treatment in HBL100 cells inhibited all three Chk1 phosphorylations induced by etoposide .
In addition , as previously observed in HEK293 cells , PP242 also suppressed total Chk1 level following etoposide induced DNA damage .
Furthermore , in other breast cancer cell lines ( HBL100 , MDA-MB-231 and HCC1937 ) , PP242 and mTOR siRNA treatment in HBL100 cells inhibited all three Chk1 phosphorylations induced by etoposide .
In line with this , recent work has demonstrated that cisplatin induced apoptosis was significantly increased by loss of Rictor but not Raptor in breast and ovarian cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Interestingly the total Chk1 protein level was also reduced by PP242 following DNA damage in these cells with the exception of HBL100 .
In addition , mTOR protein levels were transiently increased by etoposide treatment in several cell lines . ++++ mTOR protein level and phosphorylation at Ser2448 were induced by increasing concentrations of etoposide .
It was evident from Figure XREF_FIG that mTOR inhibition with PP242 or siRNA caused a reduction in total Chk1 protein and its phosphorylation , following etoposide induced DNA damage in HEK293 cells . ++++ In addition , we downregulated ATR using siRNA in HEK293 cells to determine whether etoposide induction of both mTOR protein and phosphorylation at Ser2481 were dependent on ATR .
Since mTOR inhibition in HEK293 cells significantly reduced the total Chk1 level following etoposide treatment , we explored how mTOR regulates Chk1 protein in these cells . ++++ The reduction in Chk1 level caused by mTOR inhibition could be due to faster degradation of Chk1 or inhibition of its production at transcriptional or translational level .
Furthermore , we show that ablation of mTORC2 prevents Chk1 activation and augments DNA damage induced cell death , suggesting that breast cancer cells may rely on the mTORC2-Chk1 pathway for survival .
Rapamycin had no effect on early etoposide induced Chk1 phosphorylation and protein level as compared with PP242 , suggesting that mTORC1 activity was dispensable for DNA damage mediated regulation of Chk1 .
By contrast , mTORC2 , which comprises mTOR , Rictor , LST8 and GbetaL , DEPTOR , SIN1 and PRR5 [ XREF_BIBR ] , regulates cytoskeletal organization [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and has a role in phosphorylation of AGC family members including PKC , Akt and SGK to promote cell survival and cell cycle progression [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
mTOR protein level and phosphorylation at Ser2448 were induced by increasing concentrations of etoposide .
Instead these data suggested a requirement of mTORC2 for etoposide induced Chk1 activation as siRNA against Raptor ( selective downregulation of mTORC1 ) did not affect Chk1 , whereas siRNA against Rictor ( selective downregulation of mTORC2 ) did prevent etoposide induced Chk1 phosphorylation and total Chk1 protein level .
Pharmacological inhibition of mTOR with PP242 inhibited early etoposide- and UV induced Chk1 phosphorylation in MCF7 cells , but not Chk2 phosphorylation .
By contrast , mTORC2 , which comprises mTOR , Rictor , LST8 and GbetaL , DEPTOR , SIN1 and PRR5 [ XREF_BIBR ] , regulates cytoskeletal organization [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] and has a role in phosphorylation of AGC family members including PKC , Akt and SGK to promote cell survival and cell cycle progression [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Further analysis revealed that the activation of a key cell cycle arrest regulator Chk1 was dependent on mTOR , as mTOR inhibition prevented etoposide induced increase of Chk1 phosphorylation and total protein level .
The mTORC2 specific phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 was also monitored by western blot to confirm that mTORC2 activity was sufficiently inhibited by PP242 in these cell lines .
On the other hand , inhibition of the MAPK pathway dramatically increased endogenous FBW7 abundance . ++++ ERK negatively regulates FBW7 stability . ++++ To dissect a possible role of self ubiquitination in ERK mediated FBW7 degradation , we generated a FBW7 R465H mutant that could not ubiquitinate substrates based on a previous report 21 . ++++ To test the hypothesis that the activation of MAPK signaling negatively regulates FBW7 , we examined the expression of FBW7 at both the mRNA and protein levels by q-PCR and immunoblotting , respectively , upon overexpression of ERK1 kinase in two pancreatic cancer cell lines .
Furthermore , the phospho deficient T205A FBW7 mutant is resistant to ERK activation and could significantly suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis .
We found that decreased IHC signal of FBW7 correlated with poor tumor differentiation ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; P = 0.017 ) .
These results collectively demonstrate how the oncogenic KRAS mutation inhibits the tumor suppressor FBW7 , thus revealing an important function of KRAS mutations in promoting pancreatic cancer progression .
These results suggest that activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway negatively regulates FBW7 stability in pancreatic cancer cells .
As expected , in the current study , we found that FBW7 levels are inversely correlated with ERK activation in PDAC . ++++ Taken together , these results suggest that the abundance of FBW7 inversely correlates with ERK activation in PDAC .
Similarly , downregulation of endogenous ERK1 by shRNA constructs significantly increased the abundance of FBW7 in SW1990 cells ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Overall , oncogenic KRAS signaling in PDAC is through three major pathways : Raf/MEK/ERK , PI3K/Pdk1/Akt and the Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factor pathway 25 .
To explore the mechanism by which ERK kinase modulates FBW7 stability , we investigated whether there is a direct interaction between FBW7 and ERK1 .
Another example is that the oncoprotein NEDD4-1 negatively regulates the stability of the tumor suppressor PTEN by catalyzing PTEN polyubiquitination and destruction in lung cancer XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
Intriguingly , only the level of c-Myc decreased significantly , suggesting a central role for c-Myc in FBW7 mediated PDAC inhibition .
Additionally , the phosphorylation of FBW7 by ERK was abolished by calf intestinal phosphatase ( CIP ) treatment ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that ERK kinase modulates FBW7 in a phosphorylation dependent manner . ++++ To further understand how ERK kinase phosphorylates FBW7 in vivo , we developed a specific antibody that only recognizes FBW7 phosphorylated at the T205 site . ++++ ERK kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the tumor suppressor FBW7 in pancreatic cancer . ++++ To prove that ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7 , glutathione S-transferase ( GST )-fused recombinant FBW7 proteins , both wild type and T205A mutant , were incubated with purified HA-ERK1 kinase in the presence of ATP and detected with the p-FBW7 antibody . ++++ Next , we investigated whether ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7 , as they physically interact .
Thus , these data together suggest that ERK kinase directly phosphorylates FBW7 at the T205 site . ++++ ERK phosphorylates FBW7 at T205 . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG , ERK kinase could also specifically phosphorylate FBW7 at T205 in vitro .
Thus , we hypothesized that ERK kinase promotes FBW7 ubiquitination in a Pin1 dependent manner . ++++ Together , these data strongly suggest that ERK kinase promotes FBW7 ubiquitination in a T205 phosphorylation- and Pin1 dependent manner .
We further showed that ERK directly interacted with FBW7 and phosphorylated FBW7 at Thr205 , which sequentially promoted FBW7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation . ++++ We demonstrate that ERK kinase directly interacts with and phosphorylates FBW7 at Thr205 , which leads to the ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of FBW7 itself and the elevation of multiple FBW7 substrates , such as c-Myc , thus facilitating the proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells .
Moreover , depletion of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 by siRNA transfection or trametinib treatment significantly reduced the ubiquitination of FBW7 ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) , indicating an important role for ERK kinase in regulating FBW7 ubiquitination .
Notably , co-transfection of a constitutively active form of MEK1 ( MEK1-CA ) or ERK1 kinase dramatically increased the phosphorylation of wild-type FBW7 but not the T205A mutant , suggesting that MAPK kinase signaling indeed controls FBW7 phosphorylation status ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) .
We further showed that ERK directly interacted with FBW7 and phosphorylated FBW7 at Thr205 , which sequentially promoted FBW7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .
Before our study , a report demonstrated that Pin1 , the only peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase , interacts with FBW7 in a phospho-T205-dependent manner and promotes FBW7 self ubiquitination and protein degradation 21 .
We further showed that ERK directly interacted with FBW7 and phosphorylated FBW7 at Thr205 , which sequentially promoted FBW7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .
First , we observed that wild-type HA-ERK1 , but not kinase dead mutant , greatly increased the poly-ubiquitination of WT-FBW7 but not the T205A mutant ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) .
Furthermore , co-transfection of Kras G12D also significantly promoted the ubiquitination of FBW7 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Moreover , depletion of endogenous ERK1 and ERK2 by siRNA transfection or trametinib treatment significantly reduced the ubiquitination of FBW7 ( XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG ) , indicating an important role for ERK kinase in regulating FBW7 ubiquitination .
In summary , by exploring signaling pathways unique to PDAC and absent from other types of cancer , we demonstrated for the first time that the oncogenic KRAS-MAPK signaling cascade , one of the major driving forces for PDAC progression , phosphorylates the tumor suppressor FBW7 at the T205 site and promotes FBW7 ubiquitination and destruction .
Together , these data strongly suggest that ERK kinase promotes FBW7 ubiquitination in a T205 phosphorylation- and Pin1 dependent manner .
This low expression level is well explained by the finding that cylin A/CDK2 phosphorylates the CDK inhibitor p27 and triggers its destruction by the oncoprotein SCF-SKP2 in many cancer types 26 , such as oral squamous cell carcinoma 27 .
Indeed , depletion of endogenous Pin1 by siRNA drastically reversed the ERK promoted poly-ubiquitination of FBW7 ( XREF_FIG ) .
In summary , by exploring signaling pathways unique to PDAC and absent from other types of cancer , we demonstrated for the first time that the oncogenic KRAS-MAPK signaling cascade , one of the major driving forces for PDAC progression , phosphorylates the tumor suppressor FBW7 at the T205 site and promotes FBW7 ubiquitination and destruction .
Therefore , through the phosphorylation and inhibition of FBW7 , the KRAS-MAPK axis may mainly rescue c-Myc expression to trigger a major alteration in the transcription profile towards malignancy and cell growth advantage .
To further clarify whether PD induced autophagy depended on p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK activation and p-Erk1/2 suppression , cells were treated with U0126 ( an inhibitor of Erk1/2 ) , SP600125 ( an inhibitor of JNK ) or SB203580 ( an inhibitor of p38 ) for 4 h followed by treatment with or without PD for 24h . ++++ To further clarify whether PD induced autophagy depended on p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK activation and p-Erk1/2 suppression , cells were treated with U0126 ( an inhibitor of Erk1/2 ) , SP600125 ( an inhibitor of JNK ) or SB203580 ( an inhibitor of p38 ) for 4 h followed by treatment with or without PD for 24h .

Our results provided evidence that insulin activated this signaling pathway leading to autophagy suppression , the effect of insulin was abolished by PD addition .
Meanwhile , LC3-II and actin ratio in both cell lines was suppressed by insulin , however , this effect of insulin was reduced by PD pretreatment ( P < 0.01 ) .

And our previous studies had found PD significantly inhibited cell proliferation and viability in NSCLC cell lines NCI-H460 and A549 in a dose- and time dependent manner , and it induced apoptosis through mitochondrial dependent and Erk signaling pathways ( under submitting ) .
And our previous study discovered that the inhibition of Erk signaling pathway by PD treatment induced apoptosis in NCI-H460 and A549 cells .

Similarly to LY294002 , PD inhibited p-Akt ( Ser473 ) , meanwhile , it weakened the feedback activation of RAP on p-Akt ( Ser473 ) in both cell lines .
Taken together , these findings suggested that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells through inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and activating JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways . ++++ Taken together , these results demonstrated that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells through activation of p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK , while inhibition of p-Erk1/2 was not responsible for PD induced autophagy . ++++ Subsequently , we used insulin to further clarify the correlation between insulin mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and PD induced autophagy . ++++ Taken together , these results demonstrated that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells through activation of p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK , while inhibition of p-Erk1/2 was not responsible for PD induced autophagy . ++++ Additionally , the effects assessed with a panel of pharmacologic inhibitors , including U0126 ( Erk1/2 kinase inhibitor ) , SP600125 ( JNK kinase inhibitor ) and SB203580 ( p38 MAPK kinase inhibitor ) suggested that the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK participated in PD induced autophagy . ++++ Taken together , it was clearly suggested that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway . ++++ Collectively , these results provided evidence that PD induced autophagy in NCI- H460 and A549 cell lines . ++++ To further clarify whether PD induced autophagy depended on p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK activation and p-Erk1/2 suppression , cells were treated with U0126 ( an inhibitor of Erk1/2 ) , SP600125 ( an inhibitor of JNK ) or SB203580 ( an inhibitor of p38 ) for 4 h followed by treatment with or without PD for 24h . ++++ To better understand the molecular mechanisms of PD induced autophagy , we determined the possible involvement of this signaling pathway . ++++ Here , our present study confirmed that PD induced autophagy in both NCI-H460 and A549 cells via up-regulating the expression levels of Atg-3 , Atg-7 and Beclin-1 . ++++ However , whether PD induces autophagy in both cell lines and its molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated . ++++ Further detection of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway compared to LY294002 ( PI3K kinase inhibitor ) , RAP ( mTOR kinase inhibitor ) and insulin ( an activator of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway ) showed that PD induced autophagy through inhibiting the pathway at p-Akt ( Ser473 ) , p-p70S6K ( Thr389 ) and p-4EBP1 ( Thr37/46 ) in both cell lines . ++++ PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells . ++++ In this study , we aimed to investigate the effects of PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cell lines and its underlying mechanisms focusing on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in PD induced autophagy . ++++ Our results indicated that PD induced autophagy as evidence by increasing the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and the accumulation of Atg-3 , Atg-7 and Beclin-1 in a dose- and time dependent manner . ++++ These results suggested that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells was associated with the inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway . ++++ Our preliminary studies have demonstrated that PD has an anti-NSCLC effect associated with the induction of apoptosis , however , whether PD induces autophagy in NSCLC cells has yet to be identified . ++++ To further clarify whether PD induced autophagy was connected with p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK activation and p-Erk1/2 suppression , cells were pretreated with the pharmacological inhibitors SB203580 , SP600125 or U0126 respectively , and then treated with or without PD . ++++ However , whether PD induces autophagy and its molecular mechanisms remains unknown . ++++ However , we also found the ratio of LC3-II and LC3-I in PD co-treatment with U0126 group was lower than that treated by PD alone , indicating that p-Erk1/2 was not responsible for PD mediated autophagy . ++++ Collectively , these results provided obvious evidence that PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells . ++++ To investigate the role of MAPK signaling pathways in PD induced autophagy , the activation of JNK , Erk1/2 and p38 MAPK was examined by Western blot assay using phosphorylated antibodies specific for the active forms of these kinases . ++++ In conclusion , our experiments provided the first evidence that PD induced autophagy via inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and activating JNK and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in NSCLC cells . ++++ In accordance with these findings , our results demonstrated the activation of JNK and p38 MAPK was involved in PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cells . ++++ In this study , we aimed to investigate the effects of PD induced autophagy in NCI-H460 and A549 cell lines and its underlying mechanisms focusing on the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways in PD induced autophagy .

Further detection of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway compared to LY294002 ( PI3K kinase inhibitor ) , RAP ( mTOR kinase inhibitor ) and insulin ( an activator of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway ) showed that PD induced autophagy through inhibiting the pathway at p-Akt ( Ser473 ) , p-p70S6K ( Thr389 ) and p-4EBP1 ( Thr37/46 ) in both cell lines . ++++ Subsequently , we used insulin to further clarify the correlation between insulin mediated activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and PD induced autophagy .
To further clarify whether PD induced autophagy depended on p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK activation and p-Erk1/2 suppression , cells were treated with U0126 ( an inhibitor of Erk1/2 ) , SP600125 ( an inhibitor of JNK ) or SB203580 ( an inhibitor of p38 ) for 4 h followed by treatment with or without PD for 24h .

Consequently , MDM2 loss can trigger a p53 independent senescence program . ++++ Thus , we wanted to ask if MDM2 knockdown could also induce senescence in a p53 independent manner . ++++ Furthermore , knocking down p53 in LS8817 cells did not disrupt either CDK4 inhibitor induced down-regulation of MDM2 or accumulation of SA-beta-gal ( or SAHF , not shown ) , nor did it prevent MDM2 knockdown induced senescence ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ First , knocking down p53 does not affect either CDK4 inhibitor induced senescence or senescence induced by MDM2 knockdown in WD/DDLS cell lines . ++++ The specificity of the shRNAs was confirmed because expression of a mismatched wobbled MDM2 allele prevented MDM2 knockdown induced growth arrest and senescence . ++++ The E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is required to block senescence in PD0332991 treated cells . ++++ The specificity of the shRNAs was confirmed because expression of a mismatched wobbled MDM2 allele prevented MDM2 knockdown induced growth arrest and senescence . ++++ First , knocking down p53 does not affect either CDK4 inhibitor induced senescence or senescence induced by MDM2 knockdown in WD/DDLS cell lines . ++++ To identify which domains of MDM2 were necessary to suppress senescence we expressed different mutant alleles of MDM2 and scored their effect in PD0332991 treated LS8817 cells .
In tumor cells inhibiting CDK4 can induce senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] or quiescence [ XREF_BIBR ] depending on the cell type . ++++ CDK4 inhibition can induce senescence in a subset of Rb positive liposarcoma cell lines . ++++ Thus we accomplished what we set out to do -- identify determinants that can distinguish whether CDK4 inhibition will induce quiescence or senescence , and in so doing we have unexpectedly identified two new molecular players ( ATRX and MDM2 ) and an event ( MDM2 turnover ) regulating geroconversion .
Nevertheless , CDK4 inhibitors induce senescence in some , but not all , transformed cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Nevertheless , CDK4 inhibitors induce senescence in some , but not all , transformed cells [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
The E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is required to prevent geroconversion in cells treated with CDK4 inhibitors . ++++ This indicated that ATRX was required for the regulation of MDM2 in responder cells treated with CDK4 inhibitors , and suggests that this might be prevented by C-terminal modifications .
In tumor cells inhibiting CDK4 can induce senescence [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] or quiescence [ XREF_BIBR ] depending on the cell type . ++++ Thus we accomplished what we set out to do -- identify determinants that can distinguish whether CDK4 inhibition will induce quiescence or senescence , and in so doing we have unexpectedly identified two new molecular players ( ATRX and MDM2 ) and an event ( MDM2 turnover ) regulating geroconversion .
As a control we also expressed the wild type large pocket ( LP ) , which could be inactivated by endogenous cyclin dependent kinases .
CDK4 inhibitors also induce cell cycle exit in untransformed cells , but typically these cells do not senesce [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Consequently , MDM2 loss can trigger a p53 independent senescence program .
Loss of MDM2 is associated with PD0332991 induced senescence in responder cells .
Furthermore , knocking down p53 in LS8817 cells did not disrupt either CDK4 inhibitor induced down-regulation of MDM2 or accumulation of SA-beta-gal ( or SAHF , not shown ) , nor did it prevent MDM2 knockdown induced senescence ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Furthermore , knocking down p53 in LS8817 cells did not disrupt either CDK4 inhibitor induced down-regulation of MDM2 or accumulation of SA-beta-gal ( or SAHF , not shown ) , nor did it prevent MDM2 knockdown induced senescence ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Finally , senescence can be prevented by enforced expression of an MDM2 mutant that fails to bind p53 .
Breast , glioma , and lung cancer cell lines expressing p53 mutant proteins can senesce when treated with CDK4 inhibitors or following MDM2 knockdown as well .
This indicated that ATRX was required for the regulation of MDM2 in responder cells treated with CDK4 inhibitors , and suggests that this might be prevented by C-terminal modifications .
Furthermore , knocking down p53 in LS8817 cells did not disrupt either CDK4 inhibitor induced down-regulation of MDM2 or accumulation of SA-beta-gal ( or SAHF , not shown ) , nor did it prevent MDM2 knockdown induced senescence ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
The E3 ligase activity of MDM2 is required to block senescence in PD0332991 treated cells .
CDK4 inhibition can induce Rb positive cells to exit the cell cycle into a non proliferative state , however , this can take the form of either quiescence , which is readily reversible , or senescence , which is more stable .
Similar to what we saw in WD/DDLS cells , enforced MDM2 expression did not affect PD0332991 induced cell cycle exit , but did prevent the accumulation of SA-beta-gal . ++++ All underwent PD0332991 induced cell cycle exit within 24 hours , and MDM2 levels decreased in all except for H358 , H3122 and Calu-1 .
In this report , using well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcoma ( WD/DDLS ) cell lines , we show that the proteolytic turnover of MDM2 is required for CDK4i induced senescence . ++++ CDK4i induced senescence associated with loss of MDM2 is also observed in some breast cancer , lung cancer and glioma cell lines indicating that this is not limited to WD/DDLS cells in which MDM2 is overexpressed or in cells that contain wild type p53 .
Because MDM2 is not overexpressed in SNB19 cells , it suggested that senescence mediated by MDM2 down regulation in response to CDK4i was not unique to those cells in which MDM2 is amplified .
Similar results were seen in LS0082 and SNB19 glioma cells -- knocking down ATRX prevented CDK4 inhibitor induced senescence and MDM2 levels did not decrease .
Thus , the senescence machinery was intact in non responders , however , CDK4 inhibition induced cell cycle exit could not drive reduction of MDM2 in these cells .
Thus , we suspect that C-terminal modifications of ATRX may affect its activity in CDK4 inhiibitor induced senescence but not its role in telomere maintenance .
Consequently , we asked whether ATRX was needed for CDK4i to induce senescence .
Together with DAXX , ATRX promotes the integration of H3 .3 into histone monomers [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Mechanistically , it is thought that CDK4 inhibition limits cell proliferation after the initial signaling blockade decays and cyclin D1 levels begin to rise [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
PD0332991 triggers the dissociation of HAUSP from MDM2 .
Thus , PD0332991 induced down regulation of MDM2 associates with a positive response to therapy .
In all the cell lines MDM2 transcripts were modestly reduced by PD0332991 , possibly reflecting the CDK4 inhibitor induced loss of p53 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
CDK4 deficiency in mice can limit tumor cell proliferation either directly by affecting Rb phosphorylation in the tumor cell , or indirectly by preventing the elaboration of a growth permissive tumor microenvironment [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
In all the cell lines MDM2 transcripts were modestly reduced by PD0332991 , possibly reflecting the CDK4 inhibitor induced loss of p53 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Thus , the PD0332991 triggered loss of MDM2 was at least partially due to increased post-translational proteasome dependent turnover .
Thus , continued MDM2 expression was sufficient to prevent PD0332991 induced senescence ; nevertheless , the cells exit the cell cycle .
The dephosphorylation of serine 395 by the WIP1 phosphatase and the binding of MDM2 to MDMX or ENIGMA and PDLIM7 had been reported to stabilize MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Furthermore , in responder cells , but not the non responder cells , the level of MDM2 was reduced by CDK4 knockdown .

In all the cell lines MDM2 transcripts were modestly reduced by PD0332991 , possibly reflecting the CDK4 inhibitor induced loss of p53 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
However , most of these modulate senescence through a p53 pathway lessening their likely impact in CDK4 inhibitor induced senescence ; nevertheless , a p53 independent pathway might have been overlooked .
The dephosphorylation of serine 395 by the WIP1 phosphatase and the binding of MDM2 to MDMX or ENIGMA and PDLIM7 had been reported to stabilize MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
In all the cell lines MDM2 transcripts were modestly reduced by PD0332991 , possibly reflecting the CDK4 inhibitor induced loss of p53 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Because ATRX deficiency prevents the loss of MDM2 we hypothesize that ATRX directly regulates a program that impinges on MDM2 regulation .
The dephosphorylation of serine 395 by the WIP1 phosphatase and the binding of MDM2 to MDMX or ENIGMA and PDLIM7 had been reported to stabilize MDM2 [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .

Although rapamycin reduced the levels of these proteins , this study surprisingly failed to demonstrate that this occurs through mTORC1 mediated suppression of cap dependent translation , since inhibition of GSK3 prevented reduction of these proteins without rescuing inhibition of phosphorylation of p70S6K , S6 and 4EBP1 and suppression of cap binding by rapamycin .
We observed that rapamycin induced cyclin D1 reduction was prevented by the presence of MG132 in all three tested cell lines .

We found that RasV12S35 cells , in which the Raf pathway is constitutively active , and RasV12C40 cells , in which the PI3K pathway is constitutively active , had reduced CD24 mRNA expression compared to control cells .
RasV12 downregulates CD24 mRNA and surface protein expression .
Since we observed that inhibition of MEK partially restored CD24 mRNA with no significant effect on protein levels we next determined if inhibition of Raf directly could restore CD24 expression levels .
Thus , these data suggest that the inhibition of the PI3K pathway could potentially activate a repressor or inhibit an activator of CD24 mRNA expression to block the effects of U0126 treatment .
Repression of CD24 surface protein expression by oncogenic Ras is relieved by inhibition of Raf but not MEK or PI3K .

In Wnt-off state , the cytosolic level of beta-catenin is kept low by its continuous degradation : beta-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 on serine 33 and 37 and threonine 41 , phosphorylation then triggers beta-catenin recruitment of ubiquitin E3 beta-TrCP ( beta-transducin repeats containing proteins ) , causing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .

Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3beta Y216 / beta-catenin regulation axis : FAK and PYK2 , elevated in adenomas in APC min/+ mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues , functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt and beta-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3beta Y216 to reinforce pathway output -- beta-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis .

The results of IB confirmed that loss of functional APC upregulated intestinal expression of c-Myc ( beta-catenin target gene ) and FAK ( c-Myc target ) ( XREF_FIG , left panel ) .
Our results indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3beta Y216 by FAK and PYK2 is a molecular determinant of GSK3beta recruitment of beta-TrCP , and is required for the activation of the Wnt and beta-catenin pathway and crucial for Wnt driven intestinal tumorigenesis .
Further , while tumor cells do not effectively target betacat for destruction , it is less clear at what step destruction is blocked by APC truncation .
Thus these studies suggest that Wnt signaling leads to either reduction in the rate of betacat phosphorylation by the destruction complex , or that it inhibits a key regulated step after phosphorylation , perhaps transfer to the E3 ligase , thus turning down an intact destruction complex , leading to high levels of betacat .
We also tested whether proteasome inhibition might trigger enlargement of the APC + Axin complexes -- this also did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
Further , neither APC2DeltaArm nor APC2DeltaSAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
Consistent with our observation that APC2 promotes growth and reduces dynamics of Axin complexes , APC2 cables intertwine with and bridge Axin cables .
APC2AA cells accumulated betacat at levels as high or higher than adjacent untransfected cells ( XREF_FIG ) , suggesting these two amino acid missense mutations substantially reduced APC2 function .
APC also has multiple betacat binding sites , the 15 and 20 amino acid repeats ( 15Rs and 20Rs ) , which have different affinities for betacat , and act redundantly to sequester betacat and fine tune Wnt signaling .
GSK3 inhibition by either LiCl or BIO increased APC2DeltaSAMPs coIP with Axin ( XREF_FIG ) .
Further , neither APC2DeltaArm nor APC2DeltaSAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
Our data suggest this would decrease APC dynamics in the Axin complex ( since APC 's Arm rpts would more strongly associate with Axin ) , perhaps reducing betacat transfer out of the destruction complex .
Thus without R2 , APC2 's Arm rpts associate more robustly with Axin complexes , slowing APC2 dynamics .
GSK3 inhibition by either LiCl or BIO increased APC2DeltaSAMPs coIP with Axin ( XREF_FIG ) .
Since GSK3 activity is inhibited by Wnt signaling , key residues in R2 and B that drive APC : Axin interaction dynamics would no longer be phosphorylated .
Interestingly , while Axin reduced total betacat levels ( XREF_FIG ) , betacat was further reduced in cells expressing both APC2 and Axin ( XREF_FIG ) suggesting that APC2 promotes more effective destruction complex activity .
Our hypothesis suggests phosphorylation of R2/B promotes release of APC2 's Arm rpts from the Axin complex , and that this would be essential for the catalytic cycle of the destruction complex -- thus mutating these putative GSK3 phosphorylation sites in motif B would reduce APC2 function in helping mediate betacat destruction .
Since removing R2/B restored APC and Axin interaction even in the absence of the SAMPs ( XREF_FIG ) , we hypothesized R2/B negatively regulates APC2 Armrpt : Axin interaction and that release of this interaction is essential to allow phosphorylated betacat to be moved on to destruction .
Interestingly , while Axin reduced total betacat levels ( XREF_FIG ) , betacat was further reduced in cells expressing both APC2 and Axin ( XREF_FIG ) suggesting that APC2 promotes more effective destruction complex activity .
A destruction complex operating at reduced levels could lead to high enough betacat levels to activate Wnt target genes but could maintain low enough levels to be quickly shut down when needed ; it would also prevent the apoptosis seen in some cell types at extremely high betacat levels .
We also tested whether proteasome inhibition might trigger enlargement of the APC + Axin complexes -- this also did not further increase puncta size or further decrease puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
Together these data support the hypothesis that APC2 enhances Axin 's ability to promote betacat destruction . ++++ These data further support the hypothesis that APC2 enhances Axin 's ability to promote betacat destruction . ++++ These data suggest APC2 may enhance assembly of Axin oligomers , stimulating formation of larger complexes .
We thus hypothesized that APC enhances Axin 's ability to promote betacat exit from the destruction complex , and thus the destruction complex 's betacat throughput . ++++ Our data suggest APC plays two roles : ( 1 ) APC promotes efficient Axin multimerization through one known and one novel APC : Axin interaction site , and ( 2 ) GSK3 acts through APC motifs R2 and B to regulate APC : Axin interactions , promoting high-throughput of betacatenin to destruction .
Taken together , however , our data suggest that GSK3 acts in part through R2 and B to promote release of APC2 's Arm rpts from the Axin complex . ++++ These data suggest that GSK3 activity promotes release of APC2 's Arm rpts from the Axin complex .
Axin puncta are dynamic protein assemblies , and the Wnt effector Dishevelled significantly increases Axin dynamics in puncta , suggesting it negatively regulates Axin self association , consistent with its known negative regulatory role in destruction complex function .
LiCl also led to robust Axin : APC2DeltaSAMPs colocalization ( XREF_FIG vs XREF_FIG ; quantified in XREF_FIG ) .
It is intriguing to speculate about GSK3 mediated APC regulation in the context of Wnt signaling .
betacat levels rise and it activates Wnt target genes .
Strikingly , this allows it to accumulate in puncta even in cells expressing Axin + APC2 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Further , neither APC2DeltaArm nor APC2DeltaSAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
APC , a key negative regulator of Wnt signaling in development and oncogenesis , acts in the destruction complex with the scaffold Axin and the kinases GSK3 and CK1 to target betacatenin for destruction .
These data suggest that R2 and B regulate APC2 dynamics in the destruction complex and that APC2 lacking them can not effectively support Axin in targeting betacat for destruction .
We hypothesize this induces a conformational change in APC2 that releases the Arm rpts from association with Axin ( step 4 ) ; since only a subset of APC2 molecules in the destruction complex would release the Arm rpts at any given time , the overall destruction complex would remain stable .
Interestingly , coexpressing APC2 substantially altered the structure of many complexes , increasing the length and complexity of Axin cables ( XREF_FIG = three representative puncta ; Videos 4-6 show 3D reconstructions ) , with APC2 and Axin cables intertwined and in some puncta APC bridging Axin cables ( XREF_FIG , arrows ) .
One intriguing study proposed that APC acts in the destruction complex to protect betacat from dephosphorylation and then targets it to the E3 ligase .
Further , neither APC2DeltaArm nor APC2DeltaSAMPs increased Axin puncta size or reduced Axin puncta number ( XREF_FIG ) .
The level of Axin over-expression needed to trigger more prominent Axin puncta is not dramatic -- for example , treatment of SW480 cells with tankyrase inhibitors increased levels of AXIN1 3-5x and AXIN2 5-20x and this was sufficient to trigger formation of Axin puncta .
Our data further suggested that R2/B negatively regulates APC and Axin interaction , a somewhat surprising role for an essential part of the destruction complex .
We hypothesized that R2/B phosphorylation by GSK3 is a key step in APC2 's mechanism to target betacat for destruction . ++++ Thus we tested whether R2/B can be phosphorylated by GSK3 . ++++ Perhaps R2/B phosphorylation by GSK3 regulates association of alpha-catenin with APC , and its binding induces alterations in APC : Axin interactions . ++++ If GSK3 phosphorylation of R2/B antagonizes Arm rpts : Axin association , inhibiting GSK3 should increase colocalization of APC2DeltaSAMPs with Axin , as did deleting R2 or B ( XREF_FIG ) .
In the current model , betacat is recruited into the destruction complex by binding APC or Axin and sequentially phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3 . ++++ GSK3 , which phosphorylates betacat , Axin and other sites on APC , also phosphorylates APC2 's R2 and B ( step 3 ; CK1 may also be involved , as it is in the other phosphorylation events in the complex ) .
Since removing R2/B restored APC and Axin interaction even in the absence of the SAMPs ( XREF_FIG ) , we hypothesized R2/B negatively regulates APC2 Armrpt : Axin interaction and that release of this interaction is essential to allow phosphorylated betacat to be moved on to destruction .
In the destruction complex , GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylate not only betacat but also Axin and other sites on APC .
GSK3 , which phosphorylates betacat , Axin and other sites on APC , also phosphorylates APC2 's R2 and B ( step 3 ; CK1 may also be involved , as it is in the other phosphorylation events in the complex ) .
Motifs R2 and B include highly conserved serine and threonines matching the GSK3 and CK1 consensuses , and this region is phosphorylated by GSK3 in vitro .
In the destruction complex , GSK3 and CK1 phosphorylate not only betacat but also Axin and other sites on APC .
In the current model , betacat is recruited into the destruction complex by binding APC or Axin and sequentially phosphorylated by CK1 and GSK3 .
mTOR is present in two distinct complexes , mTORC1 and mTORC2 , both of which can be inhibited by the KU compound .
Dynamin 2 has been shown to play an important role in tubule scission at lysosomes , and the use of the dynamin inhibitor dynasore rapidly induces a similar LAMP1 positive tubular phenotype .
mTOR is present in two distinct complexes , mTORC1 and mTORC2 , both of which can be inhibited by the KU compound .
In contrast to KU , the specific mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin only partially blocked the mobility shift of UVRAG , as it did for 4E-BP1 also , indicating that residual UVRAG phosphorylation may be due to the rapamycin-insensitive properties of mTORC1 .
We also found that mTOR inhibition reduced VPS34 activity , which is consistent with the previously published work from other groups . ++++ This could suggest that these tubules are different in nature to the ALR tubules or that inhibition of the mTOR activated VPS34 impairs the selectivity mechanism , for example by simply allowing the tubules to persist attached to the originating lysosome .
However , there is little evidence to suggest that VPS34 and its product PI ( 3 ) P also act directly at the lysosome itself . ++++ By nature of its involvement in lysosomal trafficking pathways , VPS34 has an indirect role on lysosomal function ; however , we were curious to examine whether VPS34 and its product PI ( 3 ) P play a more direct role in regulating lysosomal function , thus providing a mechanism for coordination of not only these distinct trafficking pathways , but also their common end point .

UVRAG has been shown to enhance VPS34 activity .
This is supported by the fact that lysosomes are still acidified in UVRAG phospho-mutant cells ( Fig XREF_FIG ) .
In contrast to KU , the specific mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin only partially blocked the mobility shift of UVRAG , as it did for 4E-BP1 also , indicating that residual UVRAG phosphorylation may be due to the rapamycin-insensitive properties of mTORC1 .
VPS34 catalyses the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) at the three position of the inositol ring to produce phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ( PI ( 3 ) P ) .
To investigate the possibility that mTOR regulates VPS34 , we examined lysates from three different cell lines ( HeLa , U2OS and MEF ) grown under control conditions , treated with the mTOR inhibitor KU or incubated in amino acid-free Earle 's balanced salt solution ( EBSS ) , which also results in mTOR inhibition ( Fig XREF_FIG ) .
Given that VPS34 inhibition with VPS34-IN1 prolonged auto-lysosomal tubulation , which in turn was blocked by mTOR inhibition , we explored the possibility that mTOR may directly control VPS34 activity .
This in turn induces bulk transport of autophagosomes and their contents to lysosomes , generating large autolysosomes .
The increased rate of cell death upon starvation in the dblA UVRAG cells does indeed suggest ALR tubulation is essential in maintaining lysosomal function and cell survival , especially as this can be reversed by mTOR inhibition .
It is important to note that mTOR inhibition does not reduce all pools of PI ( 3 ) P .
Taken together , the data currently suggest that persistent lysosomal tubulation , caused by loss of mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation , severely impedes cell survival and that the regeneration of lysosomes following starvation is critical to this process . ++++ As can be seen in Fig XREF_FIG , LAMP1 structures stained with lysotracker with approximately equal intensity in either WT or dblA UVRAG expressing cells , suggesting global lysosomal acidification was not impaired by loss of mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation .
lambda Phosphatase caused a mobility shift but this was prevented in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors , confirming that UVRAG is indeed phosphorylated under conditions where mTOR is active .
UVRAG dblA reduced mTOR mediated phosphorylation by ~ 70 % , similar to that of wild-type ( WT ) UVRAG phosphorylation in the presence of KU ( Fig XREF_FIG ) .
mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation enhances cell survival following long-term starvation . ++++ Taken together , the data currently suggest that persistent lysosomal tubulation , caused by loss of mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation , severely impedes cell survival and that the regeneration of lysosomes following starvation is critical to this process . ++++ Depletion of endogenous UVRAG in cells expressing siRNA resistant GFP-UVRAG ( either WT or dblA ) did not cause any noticeable change in the degradation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation ( Fig XREF_FIG ) , implying mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation does not disrupt trafficking to the lysosome or its degradative capacity . ++++ To confirm that mTOR can phosphorylate UVRAG , we carried out in vitro kinase assays using RAPTOR immunoprecipitation ( IP ) as a source of endogenous mTORC1 complex . ++++ As can be seen in Fig XREF_FIG , LAMP1 structures stained with lysotracker with approximately equal intensity in either WT or dblA UVRAG expressing cells , suggesting global lysosomal acidification was not impaired by loss of mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation . ++++ Given that our original observation showed that VPS34 activity was important in mTOR dependent lysosomal tubulation ( Fig XREF_FIG ) , we examined whether mTOR phosphorylation of UVRAG altered VPS34 activity .
Autoradiography to detect 32 P incorporation into substrates revealed that UVRAG is highly phosphorylated by mTORC1 at a level that was greater than the known substrate p70S6K . ++++ We did identify S498 of UVRAG as being phosphorylated in cells ; however , unlike S550 and S571 , this was not affected by mTOR inhibition and mutation of this site did not reduce endogenous mTORC1 phosphorylation of UVRAG in vitro ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) . ++++ Combined , the in vitro and cell data clearly indicate that mTORC1 phosphorylates UVRAG at two distinct sites .
Taken together with the in vitro data , this suggests that mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at S550 and S571 enhances VPS34 activity .
We do note that during the submission of this manuscript , a paper was published describing mTOR phosphorylation of UVRAG at serine 498 ( S498 ) However , phosphorylation inhibited VPS34 activity through enhanced RUBICON binding and decreased trafficking of endosomes and autophagosomes to the lysosome .
mTOR activates the VPS34 and UVRAG complex to regulate autolysosomal tubulation and cell survival .

mTOR phosphorylates UVRAG at serine 550 and serine 571 .
mTOR phosphorylates UVRAG at serine 550 and serine 571 .
mTOR phosphorylates the UVRAG-VPS34 lipid kinase complex .
Consistent with the data presented here , mTOR inhibition has previously been shown to inhibit total levels of cellular PI ( 3 ) P ; our data now demonstrate this inhibition is due to UVRAG dephosphorylation .
Interestingly , we did observe a phosphorylated band at the position of BECLIN1 in the UVRAG samples , which could imply that mTOR can phosphorylate BECLIN1 when it is part of the UVRAG complex .
Given that our original observation showed that VPS34 activity was important in mTOR dependent lysosomal tubulation ( Fig XREF_FIG ) , we examined whether mTOR phosphorylation of UVRAG altered VPS34 activity .
However , unlike S550 and S571 , these sites were insensitive to KU treatment and a UVRAG mutant with these residues substituted to alanine was still phosphorylated in vitro by mTOR , implying that another kinase mediates phosphorylation at these sites ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Taken together with the in vitro data , this suggests that mTOR mediated UVRAG phosphorylation at S550 and S571 enhances VPS34 activity .

In addition , EP receptors are associated with the activation of PI3K , PKC , and PKA and phosphorylation of p38 is induced by AMP activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) and Rac .
Because Tyr845 in EGFR is a substrate for Src and known to be phosphorylated by Src , we hypothesized that EP2 would activate Src , which in turn results in increase in EGFR phosphorylation at Tyr845 .
In contrast , when EP2 transfected HEK 293 cells were treated with butaprost , a 95 fold increase in intracellular cAMP level over untreated vector samples was observed ( XREF_FIG ) , indicating that the expressed EP2 protein binds to its agonist and activates Galphas protein .

For this , cells treated with etoposide for 1h , were released respectively in EdU or nocodazole containing medium and then EdU positive cells ( corresponding to S-phase progressing cells ; Figure XREF_FIG ) and phospho-Histone-H3 ( Ser10 ) positive cells ( corresponding to mitotic cells ; Figure XREF_FIG ) were enumerated [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Specifically , we analyzed by immunofluorescence ( IF ) the formation and clearance of gammaH2AX and 53BP1 nuclear foci , two biomarkers of DSBs [ XREF_BIBR ] , in U2OS CCAR2 +/+ and CCAR2-/- cells treated with etoposide for 1h , and then incubated in drug-free medium for 24h as previously reported [ XREF_BIBR ] .

As reported in the graphs , Chk2 knockdown , in CCAR2 +/+ cells , induced a significant accumulation of cells with > 60 foci and an increase in the average number of foci in the remaining cells , but this effect was not additive with that induced by CCAR2 ablation .
Since SIRT1 is the main CCAR2 target in the DNA damage response , we verified whether this protein could have some role in CCAR2 mediated DNA repair .
To investigate if accumulation of cells with unrepaired DNA breaks in CCAR2 ablated cells could be due to alterations of cell cycle progression induced by CCAR2 absence , we performed FACS analyses [ XREF_BIBR ] of U2OS CCAR2 +/+ and CCAR2-/- cells , before and after damage , and found similar cell cycle profile in both cell lines ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
For this , etoposide treated U2OS-CCAR2 +/+ and CCAR2-/- cells were harvested 6h later and analysed for the phosphorylation of the ATM targets Chk2 and KAP1 .
In particular , Chk2 phosphorylates KAP1 on Ser473 decreasing the interaction between KAP1 and HP1 proteins : this post translational modification promotes HP1beta mobilization and the reorganization of chromatin structure favoring the repair of DNA breaks inside heterochromatin [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
For this , etoposide treated U2OS-CCAR2 +/+ and CCAR2-/- cells were harvested 6h later and analysed for the phosphorylation of the ATM targets Chk2 and KAP1 .

The CCAR2 dependent failure of DNA repair is caused by defective Chk2 activity .
Upon DNA damage , the apical checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR phosphorylate CCAR2 on T454 , enhancing its inhibitory binding to the histone deacetylase SIRT1 , promoting p53 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Upon DNA damage , the apical checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR phosphorylate CCAR2 on T454 , enhancing its inhibitory binding to the histone deacetylase SIRT1 , promoting p53 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
To verify the specificity of these events , we transfected U2OS-CCAR2-/- cells with vectors encoding CCAR2 WT , CCAR2 T454A , FLAG-Chk2 WT and FLAG-Chk2 KD ( kinase dead , a catalytically inactive mutant ) and , after etoposide treatment , we found that expression of CCAR2 ( both the wild type and , to a lesser extent , the T454A mutant ) and wild type Chk2 restores KAP1-S473 phosphorylation , but not the expression of Chk2 KD , indicating that the defective KAP1 phosphorylation on S473 is caused by CCAR2 deficiency which in turn affects Chk2 activity .
Upon DNA lesions , CCAR2 is phosphorylated by the apical kinases ATM and ATR and this phosphorylation enhances CCAR2 binding to SIRT1 , leading to SIRT1 inhibition , p53 acetylation and p53 dependent apoptosis .
Conversely , the expression of CCAR2 WT led to a twofold increase in Chk2-pT387 signal , and almost a similar increase was seen by the expression of CCAR2 T454A phosphomutant [ XREF_BIBR ] , clearly indicating that , in human cells , CCAR2 positively regulates Chk2 autophosphorylation .
However , neither the phosphorylation of Chk2-T68 nor that of KAP1-S824 was influenced by CCAR2 overexpression , a finding consistent with the autophosphorylation of ATM-S1981 , which is unaffected by CCAR2 ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
To verify the specificity of these events , we transfected U2OS-CCAR2-/- cells with vectors encoding CCAR2 WT , CCAR2 T454A , FLAG-Chk2 WT and FLAG-Chk2 KD ( kinase dead , a catalytically inactive mutant ) and , after etoposide treatment , we found that expression of CCAR2 ( both the wild type and , to a lesser extent , the T454A mutant ) and wild type Chk2 restores KAP1-S473 phosphorylation , but not the expression of Chk2 KD , indicating that the defective KAP1 phosphorylation on S473 is caused by CCAR2 deficiency which in turn affects Chk2 activity .

The enhanced GSK3 phosphorylation caused by Smad4m130 and m351 mutations became more prominent when their rapid degradation was inhibited by co-transfection of a dominant negative form of beta-TrCP ( DN-beta-TrCP lacking the F-box domain , which causes stabilization of pSmad4GSK3 , 19,27 ) ( XREF_FIG , note the yellow signal in the Merged panel and brackets in XREF_FIG ) .

We first explored a possible contribution of ERK kinases , which were previously shown to negatively regulate TFEB [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Our findings suggest that the rapid rheostatic response , mediated by mTOR , allows the cell to quickly adapt to metabolic changes , while the long-term , mTOR independent homeostatic response controls the magnitude and duration of TFEB activation , and presumably limits excessive autophagy .
Strikingly , while Torin1 inhibition of mTOR was maintained for 15hours , TFEB re-inactivation began 1.5 hours following Torin1 treatment and required 15hours to inactive approximately 50 % of the population , compared to 100 % inactivation by fresh FM at 0.5 hours .
