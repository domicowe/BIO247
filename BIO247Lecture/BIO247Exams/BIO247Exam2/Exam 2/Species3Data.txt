Hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) , a major player in cancerous tissue adaptation to hypoxia , is negatively regulated by the family of prolyl hydroxylase enzymes ( PHD1 , PHD2 , PHD3 ) and asparaginyl hydroxylase , called factor inhibiting HIF ( FIH ) .
The cellular environment response to hypoxia is mediated by HIF , a heterodimeric transcriptional complex , which is post-translationally regulated by prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases .
Moreover , it has been established that FIH gene silencing reduced colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo through the p53-p21 mediated pathway [ XREF_BIBR ] .
FIH , in addition to PHDs , hydroxylates HIF-alpha at a conserved asparagine residue .

A Nexus Consisting of Beta-Catenin and Stat3 Attenuates BRAF Inhibitor Efficacy and Mediates Acquired Resistance to Vemurafenib .
In addition , Wnt5a stimulation of sensitive melanoma cell lines did not significantly attenuate the efficacy of vemurafenib .
Diminished phospho-Erk1/2 levels co-occurred with the knockdown of beta-catenin ( XREF_FIG c ) resulting in markedly reduced cell proliferation and growth arrest , which was mainly mediated by a cell cycle arrest in G1 and the induction of senescence as determined by increased SA-beta-galactosidase activity ( XREF_FIG a , b ) .
As before , beta-catenin down-regulation reduced vemurafenib resistance and lowered the IC 50 for vemurafenib 3.7 fold and the IC 50 of Stattic approx .
Furthermore , the doxycycline induced knockdown of beta-catenin even partially re-sensitized the previously insusceptible 451Lu resistant melanoma cells in terms of reduction of viability and induction of apoptosis ( XREF_FIG b , XREF_FIG a ) .
Since many resistance mechanisms have been described , most of them causing a hyperactivation of the MAPK- or PI3K and AKT signaling pathways , one potential strategy to overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma cells would be to target important common signaling nodes .

In xenopus cells frizzled-7 is also capable to activate beta-catenin after binding of Wnt5a ( XREF_BIBR ) , which could be a hint on Wnt5a dependent beta-catenin stabilization in therapy resistant melanoma cells .
Similar results were seen by Chien et al. after chronic treatment of cells with PLX4027 that did not cause increased canonical Wnt signaling activity ( XREF_BIBR ) .
In contrast , it was shown that vemurafenib treated A375 melanoma cells have activated beta-catenin signaling which in turn synergized with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Surprisingly , similar to the beta-catenin stabilization by lithium chloride , the inhibition of the interaction between beta-catenin and TCF/LEF factors enhanced the resistance towards vemurafenib in the sensitive 451Lu cell line which indicates a beta-catenin mediated TCF/LEF independent resistance mechanism by the release of beta-catenin from this complex .
This supports our previous studies demonstrating that beta-catenin can positively affect melanoma cell survival ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Stabilization of beta-catenin using LiCl increased the Stat3 reporter activity in sensitive 451Lu and Mel1617 cells to levels of the corresponding resistant cells ( XREF_FIG c ) .

We further analyzed the expression of several RTKs ( KIT , PDGFRB , MET , IGF1R , EGFR ) , the alternative MEK activator COT and BRAF on a transcriptional level .
However , their results suggest that in melanoma cells exposed to long-term BRAFi , the transcriptional effects of Wnt and beta-catenin signaling ( measured by AXIN2 transcript levels ) are uncoupled from the enhancement of apoptosis by Wnt and beta-catenin signaling .
In contrast , it was shown that vemurafenib treated A375 melanoma cells have activated beta-catenin signaling which in turn synergized with vemurafenib to induce apoptosis ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Mice were randomized into four different therapy groups : the 1st group was continued with daily injections of vemurafenib ( i.p. 25mg/kg ) , the 2nd group received drinking water supplemented with doxycycline ( 1mg/ml ) , the 3rd group was treated with a combination of vemurafenib and doxycycline and the 4th group did not receive any further therapy .
Since many resistance mechanisms have been described , most of them causing a hyperactivation of the MAPK- or PI3K and AKT signaling pathways , one potential strategy to overcome BRAFi resistance in melanoma cells would be to target important common signaling nodes .
Beyond that , activation of Wnt signaling by Wnt3a stimulation did not mediate resistance to our melanoma cells tested and also did not further sensitize the cells to vemurafenib treatment .

Furthermore , the ERN1 and XBP1 arm is indispensable for embryonic development of the exocrine pancreas ( likely through a crosstalk with developmental pathways ) and promotes cell survival upon acinar cell damage XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR .
Here , we demonstrate that HNFA and MIA2 are expressed in a subset of human PDAC tissues and that HNF1A induced MIA2 in vitro .
Since MIA2 is functionally related to protein secretion and because the UPR , activated by ER stress , couples the secretory network to cell survival in the adult pancreas XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR XREF_BIBR , we hypothesized that the MIA2 I141M variant may influence the UPR " homeostasis " in pancreatic cancer cells .
Indeed , Hnf1a deficiency in mice also induced a paradoxical consequence in the pancreas and liver in terms of carcinogenesis because it impaired large-T-antigen-induced growth and oncogenesis in pancreatic beta cells but promoted proliferation of hepatocytes XREF_BIBR .

Characterization by 5 ' RACE and sequencing of theSrctranscript induced in a PPARbeta and delta dependent manner by GW501516 in primary keratinocyte culture or by UV in mouse skin indicated its correspondence with the Src-001 transcript described in Ensembl ( ENSMUST00000029175 ) ( Fig XREF_FIG A , B ) .
Finally , Ets1 , whose expression is stimulated by activated Erk1/2 ( Fitsialos etal , XREF_BIBR ) , was enhanced in the UV irradiated dorsal skin of wild-type mice only ( Fig XREF_FIG E ) .

Src is activated by the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor beta and delta in ultraviolet radiation induced skin cancer .
Once activated , PPARbeta and delta upregulates Src expression and activity , which in turn , boosts EGFR/Erk1/2 signalling .
Increased levels of activated PPARbeta and delta enhance Src expression .
Thus , in our mouse model , PPARbeta and delta sensitizes keratinocytes to UV , promotes actinic keratosis development and progression , and stimulates the expression of EMT markers that affect basement membrane integrity .
The UV induced expression of two PPARbeta and delta target genes , Plin2andTgfbeta1 , was prevented by GSK0660 ( Fig XREF_FIG A , B ) , which also abolished the increase in Src gene and protein expression ( Fig XREF_FIG C , D ) , resulting in both decreased phosphorylation levels of EGFR and Erk1/2 ( Fig XREF_FIG D ) and stimulation of Ets1 ( Fig XREF_FIG E ) .

In nonmalignant and cancer cells , integrin mediated adhesion of unstimulated cells is usually low and can be upregulated by the addition of a cell agonist , such as PMA [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ In addition , cell agonists such as PMA that activate protein kinase C and induces phosphorylation of pERK , promote integrin mediated cell adhesion , focal adhesion formation and cell signaling in many cell types including cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ In addition , short-term exposure of cells to cell agonists such as PMA , results in increased alpha v integrin mediated cell adhesion and spreading onto ECM proteins [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

These results are consistent with previous findings that short-term PMA treatment does not enhance integrin expression [ XREF_BIBR ] , rather it activates integrins [ XREF_BIBR ] .
As this was the only breast cancer to express alpha v beta 3 , we believe that FAK independent activation of Src by alpha v beta 3 contributes to the metastatic phenotype of MDA-MB-435 breast cancers .
In MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 metastatic tumors , uPAR mediated degradation and remodeling of the ECM to facilitate metastasis [ XREF_BIBR ] , is likely of more importance than VEGFR mediated angiogenesis in the progression of these cancers .
This led us to speculate that the increase in adhesive capacity of these cell lines was a result of increased integrin activation through the action of either a co-receptor or upregulated signaling through intracellular pathways .
As this was the only breast cancer to express alpha v beta 3 , we believe that FAK independent activation of Src by alpha v beta 3 contributes to the metastatic phenotype of MDA-MB-435 breast cancers .
Engagement of integrins with ECM ligands triggers integrin clustering , and the formation , disassembly and reorganization of actin filaments , stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Cell adhesion plays a vital in the survivability and progression of a cancer as engagement of integrins with the ECM prevents some cancers from undergoing apoptosis while it induces cell proliferation in others .
As this was the only breast cancer to express alpha v beta 3 , we believe that FAK independent activation of Src by alpha v beta 3 contributes to the metastatic phenotype of MDA-MB-435 breast cancers .
In MDA-MB-231 cells , we propose that adhesion suppresses phosphatase activity allowing for pERK levels to increase , while in MDA-MB-435 cells , either adhesion increases phosphatase activity or pERK levels in suspension cells are already at maximal .
Some focal adhesions were found distributed at the periphery of MCF7 cells , while only FN induced the formation of a few focal adhesions in MDA-MB-231 cells .
Subsequently , Src phosphorylates FAK at a number of tyrosines including Y925 that serves as binding site for GRB2 , which links integrins to the MAP kinase pathway [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The autophosphorylation of FAK at Y397 , serves as binding site for Src family protein kinases which following further activation , phosphorylates a variety of substrates such as paxillin , and activates a number of protein kinase cascades [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
It is involved in anchorage dependent survival signaling and cell adhesion induces FAK autophosphorylation at tyrosine 397 ( Y397 ) , which creates a binding site for Src , C-terminal Src kinase , GRB7 , phosphatidyl inositol 3 kinase , and phospholipase Cgamma .

The histone demethylase JMJD1A induces cell migration and invasion by up-regulating the expression of the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 .
JMJD1A has been well documented to induce tumor progression by up-regulating HIF1alpha expression and stimulating angiogenesis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
In the current study , we identified one Myc responsive element E-Box at the JMJD1A gene core promoter , and showed that N-Myc up-regulated JMJD1A gene transcription by binding to JMJD1A gene promoter .
Recent genome-wide differential gene expression and RT-PCR studies show that MALAT1 decreases the expression of the anti-metastatic MIA2 ( melanoma inhibitory activity 2 ) and ROBO1 ( roundabout 1 ) , and up-regulates the expression of the pro metastatic GPC6 ( glypican 6 ) , LPHN2 ( latrophilin 2 ) , CDCP1 ( CUB domain containing protein 1 ) and ABCA1 ( ATP binding cassette , sub-family A , member 1 ) in lung cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .

While JMJD1A gene expression is up-regulated by androgen receptor activation [ XREF_BIBR ] , JMJD1A demethylates histone H3K9 at promoter regions of androgen receptor target genes , functions as a co-activator for androgen receptor , and induces transcriptional activation of androgen receptor target genes [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Another important ramification of the study [ XREF_BIBR ] is that chemotherapy drugs that inhibit ERK2 more than ERK1 could be more optimal for inhibition of oncogenic cell proliferation , but that selective inhibition of ERK1 might actually enhance cell growth and division and tumorigenesis .
The authors [ XREF_BIBR ] also found , however , that the suppressive effects of WT-ERK1 or KD-ERK1 on Ras induced cell proliferation were even greater when a version of ERK2 was used that was defective in its kinase activity .
In turn , the Rafs phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2 , which then phosphorylate and stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 .
In turn , the Rafs phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2 , which then phosphorylate and stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 .
Hyperactivation of Ras and other oncoproteins that stimulate this canonical MAP kinase pathway can induce apoptosis ; Vantaggiato and Formentini et al. [ XREF_BIBR ] have shown , however , that the antagonistic effects of ERK1 on Ras action are not simply due to an overall gain of MAP kinase activity that elicits a feedback inhibition response .
In turn , the Rafs phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2 , which then phosphorylate and stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 .
Many transcription factors that are targeted by MAP kinases , such as the AP1 Fos and Jun complex , also occur as dimers .
This also triggers the release of the ERK isoform from its MEK partner and its subsequent reassociation into active ERK homodimers [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
These ubiquitous protein-serine and threonine kinases are well known as key players in signaling pathways downstream of growth-factor receptor-tyrosine kinases , cytokine receptors and G-protein-coupled receptors [ XREF_BIBR ] ; they often indirectly mediate the actions of members of the Ras family of small GTPases .
In turn , the Rafs phosphorylate and activate the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2 , which then phosphorylate and stimulate ERK1 and ERK2 .
Gain-of-function mutations have been implicated in more than 30 % of human tumors , but chronic activation of Ras by mutated mitogen receptors occurs in even higher frequency than this [ XREF_BIBR ] .
At first glance , it is extraordinary that ERK1 can inhibit oncogenic Ras mediated cell proliferation , given that it was thought that ERK1 and ERK2 have the same targets and functions .

Similarly , MIF knockdown ( Fig S10 in XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) increased MSC migration in response to low concentrations of chemerin ( 4 ng/ml ) , but interestingly the response to chemerin at higher concentrations ( 20 ng/ml ) was not influenced by MIF knockdown ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ It is known that MIF inhibits MSC migration XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .

Indeed , while loss of function has been implicated in hyperproliferative disorders , tumor formation , inflammation , and autoimmune diseases , gain of function leads to immunosuppression and tumor metastasis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
The activation of the TGFbeta precursor is controlled by multiple processes , such as proteolytic enzymatic activity ( furins , plasmin , calpain , etc. ) but also acid , alkali , and heat induced proteolysis [ XREF_BIBR ] .
TGFbeta causes Smad- and the SAPK and p38 dependent transcriptional induction of the pro apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bmf and Bim , which in turn activate the pro apoptotic factor Bax that induces mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and activation of the apoptosome , leading to caspase dependent apoptosis in hepatocytes and B-lymphocytes [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Indeed , hypomethylation of the Platelet Derived Growth Factor beta ( PDGFbeta ) gene promotes glioblastoma cell proliferation in response to TGFbeta [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The Smads and associated cofactors bind in concert with their respective cognate recognition sites on DNA , thus ensuring specific selection of the targeted gene promoters and of the TGFbeta mediated transcription response .
TGFbeta can also signal through the mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway by activating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 and ERK2 ) , further leading to the induction of EMT [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

With respect to the potential molecular mechanism by which OA stimulates osteoclast activity , our previous in vitro studies in marrow derived osteoclasts have implicated the involvement of OA induced activation of the integrin signaling ( presumably through the RGD depending OA interaction with integrins ) XREF_BIBR . ++++ This finding , along with the observations that OA-Tg osteoclasts are larger and more spread out , is consistent with the hypothesis that the OA induced activation of osteoclast activity may involve Src activation and integrin signaling in osteoclasts .
Thus , the Tg mice generated with the OA expression construct driven by the TRAP-1B/C promoter did not result in significant OA overexpression in osteoblasts .
Thus , the Tg mice generated with the OA expression construct driven by the TRAP-1B/C promoter did not result in significant OA overexpression in osteoblasts .
While very little is known about the regulation of OA expression , this study and our previous studies XREF_BIBR have shown that OA in osteoclastic cells is up-regulated by RANKL in time- and dose dependent manner .
In light of the well established fact that RANKL is a potent stimulator of osteoclast differentiation and activity and also the well known complexity of the RANKL signaling networks in the stimulation of osteoclast differentiation and activity XREF_BIBR , it is possible that OA may yet be another novel mediator of the RANKL signaling mechanism in osteoclasts .
This finding , along with the observations that OA-Tg osteoclasts are larger and more spread out , is consistent with the hypothesis that the OA induced activation of osteoclast activity may involve Src activation and integrin signaling in osteoclasts .

OA up-regulates expression of matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) -3 and -9 in the infiltrating fibroblasts into denervated skeletal muscle XREF_BIBR .
Interestingly , overexpression of OA in osteoclasts upregulated expression of genes associated with osteoclastic activity ( e.g. , Mmp9 and Calcr ) , but not those associated with osteoclast formation ( e.g. , Nfatc1 ) , suggesting that osteoclast derived OA promotes bone resorption primarily through activation of osteoclasts rather than osteoclast formation .
The findings that overexpression of OA in osteoclasts led to upregulation of Mmp9 and Adam12 expression ( two extracellular proteases that mediate the shedding of ectodomain of membrane bound OA ) in osteoclasts of OA-Tg mice supports the assumption of an increased shedding of osteoclast derived OA from Tg osteoclasts .

The phosphorylation and the inhibition of TSC2 by AKT is the earliest link between mTORC1 and a pathway dysregulated in cancer [ XREF_BIBR ] .
However , the results described above , along with our findings showing that the effects of rosiglitazone on breast cancer growth in vitro and in vivo are similar to those obtained with the specific inhibition of ACSL4 by doxycycline treatment in MCF-7 Tet-Off and ACSL4 cells [ XREF_BIBR ] , strongly suggest that rosiglitazone effects are due to the inhibition of ACSL4 activity .
One mechanism by which this occurs appears to be through p70S6K dependent downregulation of IRS1 .
We and others have demonstrated a positive correlation of ACSL4 expression and aggressiveness in breast cancer cell lines , with the highest expression found in metastatic lines derived from triple negative ( estrogen-receptor-alpha ( ERalpha )-negative , progesterone-receptor ( PR )-negative and not overexpressing human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor ( HER2 ) protein ) tumor breast cancer ( e.g. MDA-MB-231 and Hs578T ) [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

For MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts , four days after cell injection the tumor bearing mice were randomized into the following four groups ( five animals per group ) and received intraperitoneal injections and oral administration of the respective drugs for 25 consecutive days : Group 1 ( MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts treated with vehicle ) , Group 2 ( MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts treated with tamoxifen ) , Group 3 ( MDA-MB- 231 cell xenografts treated with rosiglitazone ) , Group 4 ( MDA-MB-231 cell xenografts treated with a combination of the two drugs at the same doses used for the individual injections ) .

In contrast to that , Th1 cells are suggested to exhibit a regulatory function in the context of allergic asthma as IFN-gamma suppresses the differentiation of Th2 cells .
Thus , this pro inflammatory cytokine induces the production of IL-6 which interferes with Treg development . ++++ Furthermore , IL-17A could enhance the development of neutrophils by inducing the release of IL-6 from human bronchial fibroblasts ( Park and Lee , XREF_BIBR ; Aujla and Alcorn , XREF_BIBR ) . ++++ Thus , IL-17A recruits neutrophils and induces the production of IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and IL-1beta ( Weaver et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
This was accompanied by decreased levels of IL-6 and TGF-beta , increased numbers of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha producing CD4 + T cells as well as a significant reduction of tumor growth ( Reppert et al. , XREF_BIBR ) . ++++ According to this , blocking of IL-17A in a wild-type mouse model of lung Ad resulted in a decreased number of Foxp3 + Tregs and an increase of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha producing CD4 + T cells leading to a significant reduction of tumor growth .

For instance , they produce IL-10 after uptake of harmless antigens , which is suggested to be involved in induction of Tregs , in particular T regulatory type 1 ( Tr1 ) cells .
Furthermore , IL-27 activates STAT1 and STAT3 and thus drives IL-10 production in T cells ( Murugaiyan et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Pot et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Iyer et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Kushwah and Hu , XREF_BIBR ) .
Thus , IL-17A recruits neutrophils and induces the production of IL-6 , IL-8 , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) , and IL-1beta ( Weaver et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
It has been shown that IL-17A causes neutrophilic inflammation in allergic asthma via IL-8 as both IL-17A and IL-8 mRNA are increased in the sputum of allergic patients .
It is already known that TGF-beta , a profibrotic cytokine which is also crucial for airway tolerance , in combination with IL-6 or IL-21 drive the differentiation of Th17 cells and therefore the production of the pro inflammatory cytokine IL-17A by inducing RORgammat that is thought to be the master regulator of Th17 cells .

Apart from IL-10 , also IL-27 and TGF-beta1 produced by pulmonary DCs as well as ICOS and ICOS-L signaling seem to be involved in the induction of Tr1 cells .
Thus , IL-10 is able to suppress the production of Th1 cytokines by blocking IL-12 synthesis ( Umetsu et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
Apart from IL-10 , also IL-27 and TGF-beta1 produced by pulmonary DCs as well as ICOS and ICOS-L signaling seem to be involved in the induction of Tr1 cells .
It is assumed that IL-17A is able to synergize with IL-4 and IL-13 to increase Th2 cytokines and CCL11 secretion ( Aujla and Alcorn , XREF_BIBR ) .
Furthermore , IL-27 activates STAT1 and STAT3 and thus drives IL-10 production in T cells ( Murugaiyan et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Pot et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Iyer et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Kushwah and Hu , XREF_BIBR ) .
Apart from IL-10 , also IL-27 and TGF-beta1 produced by pulmonary DCs as well as ICOS and ICOS-L signaling seem to be involved in the induction of Tr1 cells .
In fact , it either protects epithelial cells from apoptosis through the Smad2/3 pathway or it induces an apoptotic effect on these cells by activating the p38 mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signaling pathway .
It is assumed that IL-17A is able to synergize with IL-4 and IL-13 to increase Th2 cytokines and CCL11 secretion ( Aujla and Alcorn , XREF_BIBR ) .
Apart from IL-10 , also IL-27 and TGF-beta1 produced by pulmonary DCs as well as ICOS and ICOS-L signaling seem to be involved in the induction of Tr1 cells .

Recently , Th mediated immunity has enlarged to include a third subset of effector helper T cells , the Th17 cells , termed after IL-17A , their preferentially produced cytokine ( Park and Lee , XREF_BIBR ; Aujla and Alcorn , XREF_BIBR ) .
Besides that , Stat3 inhibits the expression of IL-12 which is involved in anti-tumor responses via NK cell activation and Th1 induction ( Hatton and Weaver , XREF_BIBR ; Wang et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
However , in the central airway epithelial cells TGF-beta induces an inhibitory effect on Fas induced apoptosis ( Makinde et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
Consistent with this , IL-17A-deficient C57 and Bl6 mice are characterized by a reduced Stat3 activation , as well as increased numbers of tumor infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T cells , which produce higher amounts of IFN-gamma as compared to wild-type littermates .
TGF-beta in conjunction with IL-6 also initiates the expression of IL-23 that in turn stimulates IL-17A production .
Furthermore , mucus production and secretion is enhanced in fibroblasts due to an increased expression of IL-6 induced by TGF-beta ( Makinde et al. , XREF_BIBR ) .
Stat3 activates the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-X L as well as of IL-23 , which has been reported to promote carcinogenesis also .
Inhibition of EphA2 by dasatinib . ++++ EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited directly by dasatinib . ++++ Dasatinib inhibits ligand induced EphA2 internalisation and degradation . ++++ The results show that dasatinib inhibits EphA2 directly , which is consistent with a recent study which reported that dasatinib has an IC 50 of 17nmoll -1 for EphA2 ( Huang et al , 2007 ) . ++++ To determine whether the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited by dasatinib directly or whether the ability of dasatinib to suppress EphA2 activity is an indirect effect of Src inhibition , we performed in vitro autophosphorylation assays . ++++ Using in vitro kinase assays , we found that EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase was inhibited directly by dasatinib in a dose dependent manner . ++++ To determine whether the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase activity is inhibited by dasatinib directly or whether the ability of dasatinib to suppress EphA2 activity is an indirect effect of Src inhibition , we performed in vitro autophosphorylation assays . ++++ In a recent report , Huang et al ( Huang et al , 2007 ) showed that EphA2 was highly expressed in dasatinib sensitive cell lines and that EphA2 was also inhibited by dasatinib .

Dasatinib strongly inhibited EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 at dose levels similar to those that inhibited Src in all three cell lines . ++++ Inhibition of Src by dasatinib .
Interestingly , dasatinib was also found to inhibit EphB2 directly at similar concentrations , suggesting that this agent is a more general Eph receptor inhibitor as has been suggested recently by others ( Bantscheff et al , 2007 ; Rix et al , 2007 ) . ++++ Interestingly , dasatinib was also found to inhibit EphB2 directly at similar concentrations ( XREF_FIG ) .
In contrast , others have shown that activated EphA2 downregulates the Ras-MAPK pathway ( Miao et al , 2001 ) .
However , as seen in XREF_FIG , pronounced increases in Akt and ERK activation occurred following ligand induced stimulation in the presence of dasatinib , whereas this was inhibited by LY294002 and U0126 , respectively , as expected ( data not shown ) .

Although previous studies have demonstrated that dasatinib suppresses cell adhesion , migration , and invasion , and has potential as a therapeutic agent for metastatic cancers through Src inhibition ( Johnson et al , 2005 ; Trevino et al , 2006 ; Shor et al , 2007 ) , it seems that not all of its biological and molecular effects are due to Src inhibition ( Johnson et al , 2005 ) .

Although Src can activate Akt directly ( Jiang and Qiu , 2003 ) and as well affect Ras-MAPK pathway ( Olayioye et al , 2001 ) , activation of the EphA2 kinase has been shown to stimulate the MAPK pathway ( Pratt and Kinch , 2002 ) and phosphoinositide 3 kinase pathway ( Pandey et al , 1994 ) .

As shown in XREF_FIG , Src , FAK and Paxillin phosphorylations were inhibited by dasatinib in a dose dependent manner , with or without ephrinA1-Fc ligand stimulation , and similar effects were seen with the well characterised Src inhibitor PP2 .
As shown in XREF_FIG , Src , FAK and Paxillin phosphorylations were inhibited by dasatinib in a dose dependent manner , with or without ephrinA1-Fc ligand stimulation , and similar effects were seen with the well characterised Src inhibitor PP2 .
Interestingly , we found that in BxPC-3 cells , STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser 727 was inhibited by dasatinib but unresponsive to ligand stimulation , whereas Tyr 705 was increased following ephrinA1-Fc-binding and this effect was not inhibited by dasatinib .
Dasatinib strongly inhibited EphA2 tyrosine phosphorylation of EphA2 at dose levels similar to those that inhibited Src in all three cell lines .
Furthermore , EphA2 activation inhibits ERK phosphorylation in BxPC-3 cells , whereas producing increased ERK phosphorylation in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells .
These results show that in addition to Src , EphA2 autophosphorylation is inhibited by dasatinib in vivo .
EphA2 activation inhibited p44/42 mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphorylation at Thr 202/Tyr 204 ( phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase , p-ERK1/2 ) in BxPC-3 , yet p-ERK1/2 level was increased at the 20min ephrinA1-Fc-binding time point in PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 .
Paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr 118 was incompletely inhibited by dasatinib .
As shown in XREF_FIG , Src , FAK and Paxillin phosphorylations were inhibited by dasatinib in a dose dependent manner , with or without ephrinA1-Fc ligand stimulation , and similar effects were seen with the well characterised Src inhibitor PP2 .
Secondly , as PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment results in BAX activation , we examined if the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL could block the death response .
The cellular response to the decrease in ERK signaling reflected a marked inhibition of cellular proliferation as approximately 96 % of A375 cells treated with PLX-4032 arrested in the G1 phase of cell cycle after 48 hours ( XREF_FIG ) ; while MeWo demonstrated no change in proliferation comparing DMSO ( 24.3 % in S phase ) to PLX-4032 ( 25.4 % in S phase ) treatments ( XREF_FIG ) .
PUMA binds with high affinity to all anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins , and this should eliminate the majority of BIM associated with the OMM .
Our previous results suggested that BCL-xL could block PLX-4032 induced pro apoptotic signaling ( XREF_FIG ) , therefore we examined if BIM mediated cytochrome c release in vitro was also blocked by BCL-xL .
Indeed , the same is the case in A375 and SK-MEL-28 as ABT-737 treatment for up to 48 hours resulted in no apoptosis , which is likely explained by MCL-1 expression ( XREF_FIG , XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ; n.b. , ABT-737 does not inhibit MCL-1 ) ( XREF_BIBR ) .
B-RAF V600E inhibition alone sensitized cells to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis characterized by the rapid accumulation of BIM on the outer mitochondrial membrane , which could be functionally revealed by ABT-737 to promote apoptosis and loss of clonogenic survival .
Indeed , silencing bim eliminated the majority of cell death induced by the PLX-4032 and ABT-737 combination treatment .
Pro apoptotic signaling biochemically arises as the increased expression and/or activation of specific BH3-only proteins , and the major cellular mechanism to inhibit the BH3-only signal is by direct sequestration on the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 repertoire ( e.g. , BID directly inhibited by BCL-2 ) ( XREF_BIBR ) .
While PLX-4032 eliminated B-RAF V600E signaling leading to marked cell cycle arrest , only a fraction of cells eventually underwent apoptosis .
Indeed , transient transfection of wild type BCL-xL , but not a BAX binding mutant ( i.e. , BCL-xL G138A ) , prevented the majority of cell death induced by PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Indeed , silencing bim eliminated the majority of cell death induced by the PLX-4032 and ABT-737 combination treatment . ++++ In the current study , we were interested in defining the mechanistic intersections between PLX-4032 induced cell death signaling and resistance , and interrogated the contributions of the BCL-2 proteins in determining the fate of B-RAF V600E inhibited cells .
Indeed , transient transfection of wild type BCL-xL , but not a BAX binding mutant ( i.e. , BCL-xL G138A ) , prevented the majority of cell death induced by PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ Indeed , silencing bim eliminated the majority of cell death induced by the PLX-4032 and ABT-737 combination treatment .
Dynamic interactions between the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins govern cellular fate : agents that promote BID and BIM activity enhance apoptosis , while mechanisms that block BID and BIM activity lead to cellular survival and chemotherapeutic resistance ( XREF_BIBR ) . ++++ Despite not being able to detect significant BIM mRNA or protein accumulation in A375 R , ABT-737 pre-treatment was able to reveal a pro apoptotic signal following PLX-4032 treatment , suggesting that either minimal BIM induction or an unimplicated BH3-only protein was functional to promote apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ) .
C8-BID treatment is a positive control for BH3-only protein induced cytochrome c release to ensure all mitochondrial isolations respond in vitro ( XREF_FIG ) ; and mitochondria isolated from PLX-4032 treated MeWo are a negative control and demonstrated no response to ABT-737 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Secondly , as PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment results in BAX activation , we examined if the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL could block the death response .
We hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic proteins were directly inhibiting a PLX-4032 induced pro apoptotic BCL-2 family member , and therefore screened through all the pro apoptotic BCL-2 proteins by preparing whole cell lysates and western blot studies .
A375 R and SK-MEL-28 R lines displayed marked resistance to GSK-110212 induced apoptosis , compared to the parental lines ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
The data in XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG suggest that BIM is involved in PLX-4032 and ABT-737 induced cytochrome c release ; therefore , we directly tested this hypothesis by examining the cytochrome c releasing activity of BIM on purified mitochondria from A375 and MeWo .
Dynamic interactions between the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins govern cellular fate : agents that promote BID and BIM activity enhance apoptosis , while mechanisms that block BID and BIM activity lead to cellular survival and chemotherapeutic resistance ( XREF_BIBR ) .
As shown in XREF_FIG , heavy membranes from PLX-4032 treated A375 cells demonstrated dose dependent cytochrome c release in response to ABT-737 addition ; in contrast , mitochondria from A375 cells treated with DMSO elicited no response to ABT-737 ( XREF_FIG ) .
Secondly , as PLX-4032 and ABT-737 co-treatment results in BAX activation , we examined if the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL could block the death response .
In mouse models and the clinic , ABT-737 as a single therapy is well tolerated and does not cause any marked apoptosis phenotype ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Despite not being able to detect significant BIM mRNA or protein accumulation in A375 R , ABT-737 pre-treatment was able to reveal a pro apoptotic signal following PLX-4032 treatment , suggesting that either minimal BIM induction or an unimplicated BH3-only protein was functional to promote apoptosis ( XREF_FIG ) .
Furthermore , A375 R also displayed parallel resistance to common inducers of apoptosis , e.g. , staurosporine and cycloheximide , but not VP16 .
Thirdly , BCL-xL inhibited BAX activation suggesting that our co-treatment results in cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol to initiate apoptosis .
As control for our protein and mitochondrial purifications , we also provide evidence that MCL-1 mediated inhibition of BIM induced cytochrome c release is only reversed by the addition of PUMA ( n.b. , ABT-737 does not bind MCL-1 ) , whereas PUMA or ABT-737 could de-repress the inhibitory activity of BCL-xL , ( i.e. , PUMA and ABT-737 bind BCL-xL ) ( XREF_FIG ) ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
BIM complexes were observed in PLX-4032 treated cells , but the addition of ABT-737 markedly reduced the level of BIM associated with BCL-xL .
Indeed , PUMA addition reduced BIM levels to mitochondria isolated from untreated A375 cells ( XREF_FIG ) .
The addition of BCL-xL completely inhibited BIM induced cytochrome c release from both A375 and MeWo mitochondria ; and furthermore , this inhibition was reversed by the addition of ABT-737 ( XREF_FIG ) , which parallels our cellular results ( XREF_FIG , XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Finally , we examined the integration of BAX , BCL-xL , BIM , MCL-1 , and PUMA in the LUV system , which revealed that this unique combination of BCL-2 family proteins did not promote LUV permeabilization unless ABT-737 was added , suggesting that ABT-737 could specifically trigger BIM mediated BAX activation in this setting ( XREF_FIG ) .
As control for our protein and mitochondrial purifications , we also provide evidence that MCL-1 mediated inhibition of BIM induced cytochrome c release is only reversed by the addition of PUMA ( n.b. , ABT-737 does not bind MCL-1 ) , whereas PUMA or ABT-737 could de-repress the inhibitory activity of BCL-xL , ( i.e. , PUMA and ABT-737 bind BCL-xL ) ( XREF_FIG ) ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
In our experiments , we show that ABT-737 can promote PLX-4032 mediated apoptosis , presumably by releasing pro apoptotic BIM from anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins localized to the OMM .
In addition , down-regulation of SOX4 led to significantly reduced proliferation , migration and invasion capability of oral cancer cells . ++++ Knockdown of SOX4 significantly inhibited the proliferation , migration and invasion of UM1 cells ( P < 0.01 ) . ++++ In addition , knockdown of SOX4 promoted the migration and invasion of melanoma cells in an NF-kappaB p50 dependent manner , suggesting that SOX4 might function as a tumor suppressor gene in melanoma XREF_BIBR . ++++ In addition , down-regulation of SOX4 led to significantly reduced proliferation , migration and invasion capability of oral cancer cells . ++++ Knockdown of SOX4 suppressed the invasion capability of UM1 cells . ++++ We have also shown that down-regulation of SOX4 in UM1 oral cancer cells significantly impairs the cell proliferation , migration and invasion , suggesting that SOX4 may have a potential role in promoting the progression of OLP associated oral cancer .

Zhang et al. elucidated that SOX4 was a direct target of C/EBPalpha and downregulation of SOX4 suppressed the self-renewal of leukemic cells and restored their differentiation , indicating that SOX4 overexpression resulting from inactivation of C/EBPalpha promotes leukemia development XREF_BIBR .

In addition , tenascin-C inhibited the adhesion of human and rat SMC to fibronectin [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Tenascin-C isoforms containing the A1A2 domains also promoted SMC chemotaxis in vitro [ XREF_BIBR ] , suggesting that the splice variants that are specifically up-regulated by SMC during arterial injury may also directly attract further SMC to the injury site . ++++ These data suggest that while intact tenascin-C may drive SMC survival in atherosclerosis , towards the end stages of plaque formation , tenascin-C degradation releases cryptic fragments that mediate SMC apoptosis . ++++ These data collectively suggest that tenascin-C may modulate or destabilize SMC attachment to the ECM during migration .
Another way in which tenascin-C might contribute to fibrin mediated luminal occlusion is by triggering fibrin accumulation via down-regulation of tissue plasminogen activator . ++++ These data suggest that tenascin-C acts as a regulator of fibrin deposition by negative transcriptional control of tissue plasminogen activator , and this enables fibrin accumulation during arterial injury .
The presence of tenascin-C in three-dimensional collagen gels increased the production of MMP-12 by GBM cell lines . ++++ Although the cell surface receptor ( s ) involved remains to be determined , tenascin-C induction of MMP-12 was PKC-delta-dependent , and could have clinical relevance .
