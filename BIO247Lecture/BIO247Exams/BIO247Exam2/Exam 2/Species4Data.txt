In particular , expression of dct ( representing the melanocyte differentiation genes repressed by Sox10 ) is seen at low levels in mitfa , sox10 and sox10 ; mitfa mutants , but this is weakest and most transient in mitfa mutants . ++++ Our data supports the previous suggestion that Sox10 only functions transiently in mitfa expression and can not be responsible for long-term maintenance of mitfa expression in zebrafish ; indeed , Sox10 is likely to slow melanocyte differentiation in the embryo . ++++ Using their semi-quantitative scoring system , Gpnmb ( but not Dct , Si , or Tyr ) expression is detectable in Sox10 LacZ and LacZ mutants but not in Mitf Mi/Mi mutants XREF_BIBR , providing a hint that Sox10 dependent repression of melanocyte differentiation genes may occur in mouse . ++++ Our data supports our previous suggestion that Sox10 only functions transiently in regulation of mitfa and can not be responsible for long-term maintenance of mitfa expression ; indeed , Sox10 is likely to slow melanocyte differentiation in the zebrafish embryo .
This is strikingly consistent with the core GRN we have identified here , and supports the hypothesis that Mitfa dependent repression of sox10 requires Hdac1 .
We conclude that our data is , in fact , consistent in suggesting that Sox10 represses Mitfa mediated melanocyte differentiation .
Our analysis of gene expression patterns in zebrafish sox10 and mitfa mutants provides strong support for this , and overexpression studies in zebrafish embryos confirm the repressive action of Sox10 on Mitfa mediated transcription .
In Model B , we postulated that Hdac1 represses Mitfa dependent sox10 transcription .
In Model B , we postulated that Hdac1 represses Mitfa dependent sox10 transcription .
Our initial data provide a strong hint that the effect of Mitf , whether direct or indirect , on sox10 is highly context dependent ; Mitfa activates the sox10 promoter in the context of embryonic blastomeres , whereas it represses the same promoter in the context of melanoblasts . ++++ Testing whether Mitfa directly regulates sox10 in vivo via one or more of the 5 ' M boxes is a priority for future work .
The identification of Mitfa dependent activation of the Hdac complex proved crucial to explain the repression of sox10 transcription . ++++ Secondly , we add our demonstration that Mitfa dependent activation of Hdac contributes to the repression of Sox10 .
We show that addition of further features , including a Sox10 independent positive feedback loop regulating mitfa , and a Sox10 independent weak activator of melanocyte differentiation gene expression , are sufficient to alter the GRN behaviour to allow stable differentiation of this cell-type and to explain our in vivo observations . ++++ One solution to this problem , a Sox10 independent Factor Z driving ( low level ) expression of melanocyte differentiation genes , is incorporated into Model C ( XREF_FIG ) .
We show that addition of further features , including a Sox10 independent positive feedback loop regulating mitfa , and a Sox10 independent weak activator of melanocyte differentiation gene expression , are sufficient to alter the GRN behaviour to allow stable differentiation of this cell-type and to explain our in vivo observations .
One candidate for Factor Y is CREB , acting downstream of elevated cAMP induced by Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone ( MSH )/Melanocortin Receptor 1 ( Mc1R ) signalling XREF_BIBR .
We deduce that Sox9b can drive Sox10 and Mitfa independent melanisation displayed by sox10 mutants .
Whilst numerous transcription factors mediating fate choice from stem cells have been characterised , we still lack a robust understanding of how these factors and their target differentiation genes interact to form the gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) that result in stable differentiation .
These authors suggested a model whereby Sox10 mediated activation of MASH-1 and Phox2B drives sympathetic neuron specification , whilst initially feed-forward repression by Sox10 delays sympathetic neuron differentiation ; subsequently negative feedback by MASH-1 and Phox2B turns off Sox10 and differentiation can now proceed .
Our modelling also implied the activity of a Sox10 independent , Mitf dependent transcriptional activator of Mitfa , Factor Y , providing a positive feedback loop to allow stable melanocyte differentiation .
We proposed an analogous initial model of melanocyte differentiation in which Sox10 drives fate specification by activating mitfa expression , but perhaps delayed melanocyte differentiation by a feed-forward repression ( XREF_FIG ) .
One candidate for Factor Y is CREB , acting downstream of elevated cAMP induced by Melanocyte Stimulating Hormone ( MSH )/Melanocortin Receptor 1 ( Mc1R ) signalling XREF_BIBR .
We speculate that Mitfa may regulate recruitment to the sox10 promoter of an Hdac1 complex XREF_BIBR , resulting in deacetylation of this chromatin and repression of sox10 transcription .
Maintenance of both mitfa and sox10 arises because the sox10 inducing signals ( Factor A ) are maintained , and these in turn maintain Mitfa expression .
Our study only begins to address this issue , indicating that sox10 repression in melanocytes is Mitfa dependent , but leaves open whether sox10 is a direct target of Mitfa .
Our efforts to model Factor Z initially assumed that it was driven by Factor A , and thus remained constant .
We deduce that Sox9b can drive Sox10 and Mitfa independent melanisation displayed by sox10 mutants .
The Sox transcription factor Sox10 is also crucial for melanocyte development , where it contributes to melanocyte fate specification by transcriptional activation of Mitf , consistent with the association of SOX10 with Waardenburg syndrome in humans XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR .
We have shown multiple new features , including 1 ) Sox10 mediated repression of many Mitfa target genes ; 2 ) the transient nature of Sox10 expression in differentiating melanocytes , resulting from 3 ) Mitfa dependent repression of Sox10 , likely via 4 ) a mechanism involving Hdac1 complex ; and 5 ) Sox10 independent weak activation of melanogenesis genes . ++++ Given the lack of quantitative knowledge of most parameters , we restricted ourselves to assessing under which conditions ( i.e. parameter value sets ) the model predicted i ) the long-term maintenance of mitfa expression , ii ) an initial increase of sox10 , leading to its maximal expression at intermediate times , and iii ) long-term loss ( or downregulation , i.e. below a detection threshold ) of sox10 expression , as we have observed in differentiating melanocytes .
We have demonstrated a role for Sox10 in antagonising Mitfa dependent differentiation ; have firstly predicted , then identified Sox9b as part of , a factor with a transient role in Mitfa independent melanisation observed in sox10 and sox10 ; mitfa mutants ; have predicted and then shown that mitfa expression is , directly or indirectly , Mitfa dependent ; and have provided the first indication that Mitfa might negatively regulate sox10 expression in differentiating melanocytes . ++++ The model also predicts that the turning off of sox10 expression in differentiating melanocytes results from Mitfa dependent repression of sox10 transcription .
Furthermore , our model requires Hdac mediated repression of sox10 expression to be Mitfa dependent ; hence it predicts that Trichostatin A treatment of mitfa mutants would not result in further elevation of sox10 levels above those of untreated mitfa mutant controls .
Interestingly , these data suggest that , in contrast to dct and other differentiation genes , Mitfa dependent expression of sox10 is not repressed by the presence of Sox10 .
Co-expression of Sox10 represses Mitfa dependent expression of melanocyte differentiation genes .
Unexpectedly , we find that Sox10 represses Mitf dependent expression of melanocyte differentiation genes .
This melanocyte model predicts that Sox10 represses expression of melanocyte differentiation genes , and that in this way Sox10 antagonizes Mitfa mediated differentiation .
Interestingly , these data suggest that , in contrast to dct and other differentiation genes , Mitfa dependent expression of sox10 is not repressed by the presence of Sox10 .
However , we found that this was inadequate to allow repression of sox10 expression in the wild-type ( XREF_FIG ) , since constant Factor A persists ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) .
Mitfa regulates sox10 transcription . ++++ In contrast , in the same experiment , very few ( 6 % ) embryos injected with sox10 RNA showed GFP expression at 6 hpf , whereas essentially all transgenic embryos showed GFP by 10.5 hpf , consistent with the idea that Sox10 does not directly regulate this reporter construct , but that Mitfa expression induced by Sox10 can do so .
In contrast , our Sox10 mediated repression model predicts that Mitfa alone will be sufficient , but that whilst Sox10 alone would drive mitfa , Mitfa dependent expression of other melanocyte differentiation genes ( with the likely exception of tyrp1b ) would be repressed by the presence of Sox10 .
Several factors driving melanocyte fate specification have been identified , including the transcription factor and master regulator of melanocyte development , Mitf , and Wnt signalling and the multipotency and fate specification factor , Sox10 , which drive mitf expression .
Several factors driving melanocyte fate specification have been identified , including the transcription factor and master regulator of melanocyte development , Mitf , and Wnt signalling and the multipotency and fate specification factor , Sox10 , which drive mitf expression .
As we have noted experimentally , sox10 expression is repressed in differentiating melanocytes , so in Model C we show Hdac as repressing Factor A dependent sox10 expression , as well as Mitfa dependent activation of sox10 transcription ( XREF_FIG ) .
Hence , whilst the presence of Factor A seems to persist , as revealed by the mitfa mutant phenotype , our intuition that the influence of Factor A would be transient in the wild-type situation appears to be well founded , resulting from the global shut-down of sox10 transcription mediated by Hdac complex .
Thus Lang and colleagues demonstrated that Pax3 acted with Sox10 to drive transcription of Mitf , whilst feed-forward repression by Pax3 delayed expression of dct XREF_BIBR .
However , controversy surrounds the precise role of Sox10 , with in vivo data from zebrafish arguing that an ongoing role in melanocyte differentiation is not required in this organism XREF_BIBR , while in vitro data from mouse indicates that Sox10 may contribute to expression of melanocyte differentiation genes , Dct and Tyr XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR .

This unexpected observation suggests that the effects of PTEN on AKT phosphorylation are context dependent with PTEN limiting AKT activation under glucose replete conditions , but increasing AKT activation by an unknown mechanism under glucose deprived conditions .
Glucose deprivation inhibited AKT phosphorylation of S473 site in an ovarian cancer cell line ( XREF_BIBR ) and leukemic T cells ( XREF_BIBR ) , while transient glucose deprivation activated AKT at both T308 and S473 in HeLa cells ( XREF_BIBR ) .
To confirm that glucose deprivation downregulates AKT phosphorylation ( S473 ) in lung cancer cells lacking functional PTEN , the effect of knockdown of PTEN on AKT phosphorylation levels was assessed in three PTEN wild-type lung cancer cell lines ( NCI-H460 , EKVX , and A549 ) ( XREF_FIG ) . ++++ AKT phosphorylation ( S473 and T308 ) were selectively downregulated in PTEN mutant cell lines by glucose deprivation .
We confirmed that AKT phosphorylation ( S473 ) was significantly downregulated by PTEN knockdown under glucose deprivation conditions in the three lung cancer cell lines , albeit to a lesser degree in A549 cells .

NK cell numbers can be reduced , as has been found in patients with non small cellular lung cancer ( NSCLC ) and melanoma ( Al Omar et al. , XREF_BIBR ; Martinovic et al. , XREF_BIBR ) , and this might impact on the overall potential of patients to elicit NK cell mediated immunity .

There thus appears to be a transcriptional hierarchy in which SNAIL2 activates SOX9 , which in turn activates FOXD3 .
RAC1 is the main mammalian isoform of RAC and controls actin cytoskeletal assembly mediated by Scar/WAVE and ARP2/3 to drive actin nucleation , and by PAK and LIM kinases to drive the turnover of actin ( XREF_BIBR ; XREF_BIBR ) .
Neither Prex1 nor Rac1 mutant phenotypes can be rescued by a constitutively active N-RAS , suggesting that proliferation alone is not driving the phenotype ( XREF_BIBR ; XREF_BIBR ) .

MSC depletion is also observed in hair greying induced by DNA damage , such as that induced by X-rays or chemotherapeutic drugs , but the response is distinct from the DNA damage pathway that triggers apoptosis or senescence of other stem cell populations ( XREF_BIBR ) .
It is tempting to speculate that this might be linked to the DNA damage response , because EPMs are observed following DNA damage induced by prolonged expression of the melanogenic genes regulated by MITF ( XREF_BIBR ) , and because MITF directly regulates DNA damage repair genes in melanoma ( XREF_BIBR ; XREF_BIBR ) .
The key step during melanocyte formation is thus the activation of MITF .

A similar cross-repression mechanism also applies to SOX2 ; ectopic expression of MITF , induced by doxycycline in chick embryos , leads to rapid downregulation of SOX2 and reinforces the melanoblast fate induced by MITF ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Indeed , a modified FOXD3 protein , containing a transcription activation domain rather than a repressor domain , still repressed MITF transcription in melanoma cells . ++++ Exploring the mechanism of this switch , XREF_BIBR demonstrated that FOXD3 , in mouse melanoma cells or in quail neural crest cells , repressed MITF expression even in the presence of PAX3 and SOX10 .
A similar cross-repression mechanism also applies to SOX2 ; ectopic expression of MITF , induced by doxycycline in chick embryos , leads to rapid downregulation of SOX2 and reinforces the melanoblast fate induced by MITF ( XREF_BIBR ) .

Shb is a signaling protein downstream of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and Shb deficiency has been found to restrict tumor angiogenesis .
This may contribute to increased metastasis since it is well established that CD8+ cytotoxic T cells combat melanoma growth and metastasis [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ Absence of Shb promotes B16F10 tumor metastasis due to increased vascular permeability and reduced pericyte and myofibrillar cell coverage of endothelial cells , thus allowing intravasation and vascular dissemination of tumor cells .
Since Shb-deficiency appears to reduce tumor growth by restricting the angiogenic expansion of the vasculature , the question of whether this will cause increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis or not remains unanswered .
Since Shb-deficiency appears to reduce tumor growth by restricting the angiogenic expansion of the vasculature , the question of whether this will cause increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis or not remains unanswered .
Indeed , treatment with an activator of CD8+ T cells , Ipilimumab ( anti-CTLA-4 ) , together with an inhibitor of VEGF signaling ( Bevacizumab ) causes perivascular CD8+ cell accumulation [ XREF_BIBR ] , thus confirming the relevance of the vasculature for tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells .
Increased expression of Pten is , however , likely to have profound effects on endothelial function since this gene reduces phosphatidyl-3 '-inositol levels and thus suppresses PI3K and Akt activities .
FHL2 antagonizes the binding of Id2 to E47 , thus releasing E47 to its cognate DNA . ++++ We also showed a competitive nature between FHL2 and E47 for binding Id2 , whereby FHL2 prevents the formation of the Id2 and E47 heterodimer , thus releasing E47 to DNA and restoring its transcriptional activity . ++++ As shown in XREF_FIG B , ectopic FHL2 strongly inhibited S phase entry and abrogated Id2 stimulated DNA synthesis . ++++ These results suggest a competitive nature between FHL2 and E47 for binding Id2 , whereby FHL2 prevents the formation of an Id2 and E47 heterodimer . ++++ Finally , we proposed an anti-proliferation function of FHL2 in neural cells by showing that FHL2 can inactivate the transcriptional and cell-cycle-promoting functions of Id2 in neuroblastoma cells .
To explore the molecular mechanism by which FHL2 represses Id activities , we analyzed the interactions among E47 , Id2 and FHL2 proteins present in the nucleus by performing immunoprecipitation assays with MCF-7 cells cotransfected with E47 , Myc-Id2 and/or Flag-FHL2 . ++++ Taken together , these data strongly indicate that FHL2 can potently repress Id activities by directly associating with them , thus restoring the transcription programme driven by E47 . ++++ FHL2 slightly increased E47 activation of the reporter ( lane 4 ) , which might be due to FHL2 inhibition of the endogenous Id activities .
In contrast , FHL2 antagonized the proliferation of differentiated myoblasts by downregulating cyclin D1 ( XREF_BIBR ) and suppressed liver cancer cell growth through a TGF beta like pathway ( XREF_BIBR ) . ++++ Therefore , we investigated whether FHL2 inhibits cell proliferation and opposes Id2 mediated entry into the S phase .
FHL2 , whose expression increased during retinoic acid ( RA )-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells , competitively prevented Ids from binding to E47 and thus largely restored E47 mediated transcription .
In contrast , FHL2 antagonized the proliferation of differentiated myoblasts by downregulating cyclin D1 ( XREF_BIBR ) and suppressed liver cancer cell growth through a TGF beta like pathway ( XREF_BIBR ) .
FHL2 antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Id proteins on basic helix-loop-helix protein E47 mediated transcription , which was abrogated by the deletion mutation of Ids that disrupted their interaction with FHL2 .
We further show that FHL2 blocks Id-E47 coupling by a competitive binding mechanism , which subsequently represses the inhibitory effect of Ids on E47 mediated transcription .
An exception is APC/C CDH1 , which interacts with Id2 through the D-box domain of Id2 and mediates ubiquitin dependent proteasomal degradation of Id2 ( XREF_BIBR ) .
FHL2 antagonizes the inhibitory effect of Id proteins on basic helix-loop-helix protein E47 mediated transcription , which was abrogated by the deletion mutation of Ids that disrupted their interaction with FHL2 .
We postulated that the deletion of residues in the N-terminal region of Ids may cause a gross conformational change of Ids that disrupts the binding of FHL2 but not E47 .
Although Id2 is well known to prevent differentiation and promote cell-cycle progression and tumorigenesis , the molecular events that regulate Id2 activity remain to be investigated .
An exception is APC/C CDH1 , which interacts with Id2 through the D-box domain of Id2 and mediates ubiquitin dependent proteasomal degradation of Id2 ( XREF_BIBR ) .
Taken together , these data indicate that FHL2 is able to effectively up-regulate the expression of E47 target genes in neuroblastoma cells by directly interacting with and preventing Id2 from binding to E47 . ++++ FHL2 up-regulates the expression of E47 target genes by inactivating Id2 activity in SK-N-SH cells .
The interaction of FHL2 with all Id proteins is not equivalent in this assay , as demonstrated in XREF_FIG A ; the retention of FHL2 by GST-Id3 is substantially greater than that of the others , given the apparent lower level of this GST fusion protein .
In this study , we demonstrated an antagonistic effect of FHL2 on Id2 driven proliferation of neuroblastoma cell types .
In the past decade , numerous reports demonstrated the aberrant accumulation of Id proteins in solid tumors and Ids facilitating tumorigenesis by repressing cell differentiation , stimulating cell proliferation and promoting tumor neoangiogenesis ( XREF_BIBR ) .
FHL2 antagonizes the inhibition of E-box-mediated transcription by Ids , but not by Id-dels .
The luciferase activity was significantly enhanced by cotransfection of GAL4-DBD-FHL2 with the VP16-Id2-DBM or VP16-Id2-DBM-deltaHLH vector in a dose dependent manner ( XREF_FIG B ) .
The opposite expression style and interaction of FHL2 and Id2 during cell differentiation induced by RA suggested an antagonistic role of FHL2 for Id2 activity .
FHL2 expression was remarkably up-regulated during retinoic acid induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells , during which the expression of Id2 was opposite to that .
As shown in XREF_FIG B , the chimeric GAL4-DBD-FHL2 protein only weakly activated the GAL4 dependent reporter gene , by approximately three- to four-fold in these cells , which is consistent with previous reports ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Id2 induced a significant decrease of p57 Kip2 mRNA expression , but this effect was markedly attenuated by FHL2 . ++++ In accordance with a previous report ( XREF_BIBR ) , we also demonstrated that the expression of these genes was strongly induced by E47 and inhibited by Id2 .
The fact that RA induced the reverse expression of Id2 and its functional repressor FHL2 ( XREF_FIG ) indicated that FHL2 may be an important stalker against Id2 protein activity in neuroblastoma cells . ++++ Altogether , these data suggest that the ectopic or RA induced expression of FHL2 can effectively inhibit cell-cycle progression of neuroblastoma cells by antagonizing Id2 activity .
Rb binds to and antagonizes Id2 from binding to transcription factors , thus releasing bHLH protein mediated transcription ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .

As shown in XREF_FIG A , FHL2 transfection markedly up-regulated the mRNA expression of p57 Kip2 , IGF2 and H19 .
For example , FHL2 promoted SKI induced proliferation of UCD-Mel-N melanoma cells and enhanced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells by regulating cell-cycle-dependent p21 expression ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Ectopic expression of FHL2 in neuroblastoma cells strongly induced the expression of p57 Kip2 , IGF2 and H19 genes by regulating the Id2-E47 transcriptome ( XREF_FIG ) .
This explanation was supported by the fact , like that the formation of a ternary complex by FHL2 , CBP and p300 , and beta-catenin could synergistically activate AR mediated transcription ( XREF_BIBR ) , and that FHL2 interacts with titin , a protein that plays a crucial role as organizer of the sarcomere , and functions as an adaptor molecule that links the metabolic enzymes MM-creatine kinase , adenylate cyclase and phosphofructokinase to titin , thereby helping to recruit metabolic enzymes needed for energy provision during muscle contraction ( XREF_BIBR ) .
For example , FHL2 promoted SKI induced proliferation of UCD-Mel-N melanoma cells and enhanced proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells by regulating cell-cycle-dependent p21 expression ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Rb binds to and antagonizes Id2 from binding to transcription factors , thus releasing bHLH protein mediated transcription ( XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ) .
Ectopic FHL2 expression did not change the protein levels of Id2 , E47and beta-actin but increased the protein level of p57 Kip2 .
As shown in XREF_FIG A , FHL2 transfection markedly up-regulated the mRNA expression of p57 Kip2 , IGF2 and H19 .
Loss of FHL2 downregulated the expression of cyclin D1 and greatly reduced the proliferative capacity of mouse embryo fibroblasts ( XREF_BIBR ) .

Interestingly , we found that jasplakinolide , a macrocyclic peptide that induces actin polymerization ( Sheikh et al. 1997 ) , negated the effect of the antitetraspanin mAb on cell morphology ( XREF_FIG J ) .
First , we found that LY29004 , a specific inhibitor of PI3K , has completely abolished a morphogenetic effect of the mAbs and attenuated mAb induced invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 cells .
In osteosarcoma cells , wide range inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases could prevent upregulation of MMP-1 by collagen ( Riikonen et al. 1995 ) .
This may subsequently increase production of PtdIns-3 ,4-P2 .
It was hypothesized that tetraspanins may be implicated in the assembly of integrin containing signaling complexes , thus modulating the function of integrin receptors in cell migration ( Hemler et al. 1996 ; Berditchevski et al. 1997b ; Domanico et al. 1997 ; Maecker et al. 1997 ; Yanez-Mo et al. 1998 ; Yauch et al. 1998 ) .
In turn , activation of PI3K may be linked to tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins ( Shaw et al. 1997 ) , which either directly ( through Src homology 2 [ SH2 ] domain of p85 subunit of the class I PI3K ) or indirectly ( through Ras dependent activation of p110 subunit of PI3K ) recruit and activate the enzyme ( Rodriguez-Viciana et al. 1996 ; Fruman et al. 1998 ) .
Importantly , in preliminary experiments we have established that although it stimulates cell invasion , the anti-alpha2 mAb has minimal effect on chemotactic migration of the MDA-MB-231 cells towards absorbed Matrigel ( Sugiura , T. , and F. Berditchevski , unpublished results ) .
We found that both broad-range ( BB 3103 ) and more selective ( TIMP-2 ) inhibitors of MMPs decreased invasiveness of the MDA-MB-231 cells ( XREF_FIG C ) .
As illustrated in XREF_FIG B , inhibitors to PI3K , myosin light chain kinase , and one of the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors , genistein , efficiently blocked cellular invasion induced by the antitetraspanin mAb , with only a minimal effect on the basal level of invasion .
It was hypothesized that tetraspanins may be implicated in the assembly of integrin containing signaling complexes , thus modulating the function of integrin receptors in cell migration ( Hemler et al. 1996 ; Berditchevski et al. 1997b ; Domanico et al. 1997 ; Maecker et al. 1997 ; Yanez-Mo et al. 1998 ; Yauch et al. 1998 ) .
Thus , we concluded that the PI3K dependent signaling pathway makes an essential contribution in the production of MMP-2 triggered by the alpha3beta1-tetraspanin complexes .
Our results indicate that alpha3beta1-tetraspanin protein complexes play an important role in regulating protrusive activity of the tumor cells and contribute to ECM induced production of MMP-2 .
In ovarian cancer cells , both focal adhesion kinase and Ras are required for production of MMP-9 induced by fibronectin ( Shibata et al. 1998 ) .
As shown in XREF_FIG A , continuous presence of various antitetraspanin mAbs during the time of the assay ( tested separately or in combinations ) increased invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 cells 1.5-3 .5-fold .
It was hypothesized that tetraspanins may be implicated in the assembly of integrin containing signaling complexes , thus modulating the function of integrin receptors in cell migration ( Hemler et al. 1996 ; Berditchevski et al. 1997b ; Domanico et al. 1997 ; Maecker et al. 1997 ; Yanez-Mo et al. 1998 ; Yauch et al. 1998 ) .
Thus , it is possible that either alpha3beta1 dependent activation of MMP-2 in rhabdomyosarcoma cells involves a different type of alpha3beta1 containing protein complex ( es ) ( that is not expressed on MDA-MB-231 cells ) or the alpha3beta1-tetraspanin-induced signaling pathway is partly deficient in the breast carcinoma cells .
Conversely , we can not exclude a possibility that alpha3beta1-tetraspanin protein complexes modulate activity of phosphoinositide phosphatases ( e.g. , SH2 domain containing inositol 5 '-phosphatase , PTEN ) , thus affecting local concentrations of D-3 phosphoinositides available for binding to their protein targets ( including c-Akt ) .
Integrin mediated adhesion to laminin and antibody induced clustering of alpha3beta1 integrin enhanced the secretion of MMP-2 in rhabdomyosarcoma and glioblastoma cells ( Chintala et al. 1996 ; Kubota et al. 1997 ) .
Ligation of the alpha3beta1-tetraspanin protein complexes with monoclonal antibodies specifically stimulates production of matrix metalloproteinase 2 ( MMP-2 ) and induces formation of long invasive protrusions within Matrigel .
Interestingly , we found that jasplakinolide , a macrocyclic peptide that induces actin polymerization ( Sheikh et al. 1997 ) , negated the effect of the antitetraspanin mAb on cell morphology ( XREF_FIG J ) .

In control studies , non targeting siRNAs affected neither PMCA4b gene expression nor RNLS mediated ERK phosphorylation ( XREF_FIG , left panel ) .
Our results suggest a feed-forward loop between RNLS and STAT3 : signals that upregulate STAT3 increase RNLS gene expression , and RNLS , in turn , increases STAT3 activity .

The data suggest that the ability of sorafenib to activate GSK-3beta and alter the intracellular distribution of p53 may be exploitable as an adjunct to agents that prevent the HDM2 dependent degradation of p53 in the treatment of melanoma .
As with Bim , tBid , and Puma , the ability of p53 to bind to and activate Bak and Bax in the mitochondria is limited by the relative abundance of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .

As shown in Figure XREF_FIG ( lower panel ) , exposure to MI-319 increased the nuclear pool of p53 in SKMEL5-GSK-3beta S9A cells and the addition of sorafenib induced its disappearance from the nucleus and translocation to the mitochondria , similar to what was observed in melanoma cell lines with high constitutive GSK-3beta activity such as A375 . ++++ In responsive cell lines , the MI-319 and sorafenib combination induced the disappearance of p53 from the nucleus , the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L , the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria and that of AIF to the nuclei . ++++ To assess the role played by GSK-3beta in the redistribution of p53 induced by sorafenib in the setting of HDM2 blockade , we stably transfected A375 melanoma cells with a tetracycline inducible GSK-3beta shRNA and SKMEL5 cells with a constitutively active GSK-3beta ( GSK-3beta S9A ) and examined the response of the transfectants to MI-319 and sorafenib . ++++ The addition of sorafenib , however , prevented this increase in nuclear p53 and induced the accumulation of p53 in the mitochondria in A375 , but not SKMEL5 cells . ++++ In this report , we show that in the presence of the HDM2 antagonist MI-319 , sorafenib induces the disappearance of p53 from the nucleus and its translocation to the mitochondria in melanoma cells .

In responsive cell lines , the MI-319 and sorafenib combination induced the disappearance of p53 from the nucleus , the down modulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L , the translocation of p53 to the mitochondria and that of AIF to the nuclei . ++++ The nuclear accumulation of p53 induced by MI-319 alone appears to be well tolerated by melanoma cells both in vitro and in vivo .
The translocation was , however , readily achieved with the sorafenib/MI -319 combination but could be blocked with pifithrin-mu , suggesting that it was mediated by mitochondrial p53 .
We previously showed that single agent sorafenib induced the release of cytochrome c but not AIF from the mitochondria of A375 cells .
It can also induce a caspase independent form of death mediated by the translocation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor ( AIF ) from the mitochondria to the nuclei .
GSK-3beta activation , for example , generally inhibits apoptosis triggered by the engagement of death receptors [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] but enhances the apoptotic response to death signals originating in the mitochondria [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
This particular function of p53 can trigger the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria , the activation of caspases , and death through a classical apoptotic mechanism .
Although p53 resides primarily in the nucleus , there is a substantial cytosolic pool of p53 that in response to an apoptotic stimulus , translocates to the mitochondria , binds to Bax and Bak directly , and induces programmed cell death in a manner similar to that mediated by certain BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family ( i.e. Bim , tBid , and Puma ) [ XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .

To determine if the activation of GSK-3beta had a similar protective role in cells exposed to both sorafenib and MI-319 , A375 cells stably transfected with a tetracycline-regulable GSK-3beta shRNA were treated with 3 muM doxycycline overnight or left untreated and then exposed to sorafenib and MI-319 .
The cell death elicited by the combination of sorafenib and MI-319 can be inhibited by pifithrin-mu , an agent known to selectively block p53 function in the mitochondria without affecting p53 dependent gene expression [ XREF_BIBR ] .
It can also induce a caspase independent form of death mediated by the translocation of Apoptosis Inducing Factor ( AIF ) from the mitochondria to the nuclei .
p53 mediates cell cycle arrest , senescence , and/or programmed cell death in response to DNA damage , hypoxia , and other cellular stresses [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
In addition , the vascularity of xenografts from mice treated with MI-319 and sorafenib was decreased relative to that of mice treated with sorafenib alone , which was in turn decreased relative to controls .
Pifithrin-mu also failed to protect SKMEL5 cells from the proapoptotic effects of sorafenib/MI -319 unless the constitutively low GSK-3 activity of these cells was enhanced by the forced expression of GSK-3beta S9A ( p < 0.0212 ) .
We previously showed that single agent sorafenib induced the release of cytochrome c but not AIF from the mitochondria of A375 cells .
As shown in Figure XREF_FIG , the downmodulation of GSK-3beta enhanced the toxicity of single agent sorafenib ( as previously reported ) but reduced the toxicity of the sorafenib/MI -319 combination ( p < 0.0062 for sorafenib/MI -319 with or without doxycycline ) .
In cells with low GSK-3beta activity , p53 remains largely nuclear and it is therefore conceivable that in these circumstances the increase in p21 waf induced by MI-319 limits ROS production and the processing and subsequent release of AIF from the mitochondria .
Effects of GSK-3beta activation and HDM2 blockade on sorafenib induced Bcl-2 and Bcl-x L down modulation .
As shown in Figure XREF_FIG ( red filter only ) , AIF was excluded from the nuclei of tumors excised from control mice and those treated with either sorafenib or MI-319 .
Sorafenib induced caspase activation ( PARP cleavage ) was delayed in these cells ( evident at only 24 hours ) and did not appear to contribute to the lethality of the drug as the cells were not protected by the pancaspase inhibitor ZVAD [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Routine H&E staining revealed a marked increase in the extent of necrosis in tumors from mice treated with either single agent sorafenib or the drug combination Ki-67 staining and TUNEL assays limited to areas of tumor that were not overtly necrotic revealed no differences among the treatment groups ( data not shown ) .
Analysis of microvessel density using antibodies to CD31 showed a statistically significant decrease in vascularity in tumors treated with sorafenib alone relative to controls ( p < .024 ) and an even greater decrease in vascularity in tumors treated with the MI-319 and sorafenib combination relative to sorafenib alone ( p < .006 ) .
Suppression of GSK-3beta by adding doxycycline prevented the redistribution of p53 induced by sorafenib .

TNFalpha and insulin do not trigger hepatocyte proliferation , but enhance the effect of mitogens [ XREF_BIBR ] .
There has been considerable debate concerning whether IL-6 itself can induce proliferation because studies have yielded opposing results in the past [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR ] .
Thus , it can not be excluded that a treatment like insulin that failed to trigger statistically significant DNA replication in our experiments , may be capable of doing so in a different system [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Hence , MAPK activation by JAK that is a target downstream of IL-6 , and at least one link between the MAPK and PI3K cascades were necessary to enable induction of DNA synthesis by IL-6 .
In our network , Raf1 did not induce PI3K pathway activation and was hence not identified by our analysis .

They could show that RNAi mediated silencing of STAT3 resulted in radiosensitization of A431 cells .
Mechanistically , there is evidence to suggest that the sensitization effect following combined STAT3 inhibition and radiation in HNSCC is mediated by apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , enhanced residual DNA-damage assessed by gammaH2AX staining [ XREF_BIBR ] or comet assay [ XREF_BIBR ] , G2/M cell cycle arrest [ XREF_BIBR ] , and reduced tumor angiogenesis in murine xenografts of HNSCC cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
This treatment resulted in a pronounced decrease of the clonogenic survival due to RV induced apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Sustained activation of STAT3 can promote tumor cell survival and migration .
Consistent with this , blocking STAT3 activity with antioxidants , as well as STAT3 activation by reactive oxygen species has been shown to enhance cell survival [ XREF_BIBR ] , while mitochondrial overexpression of STAT3 promoted the growth of cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Furthermore , STAT proteins may also be activated through direct phosphorylation by some receptor tyrosine kinases , e.g. , EGFR , or non receptor kinases , e.g. , c-SRC [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .

Potential Mechanisms of STAT3 Mediated Radio- and Chemoradiotherapy-Resistance .
Kim and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that overexpression of another dominant negative STAT3 , which inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr 7 05 , resulted in radiosensitization of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited by panitumumab , accompanied by a sensitization to irradiation both in vitro and in vivo [ XREF_BIBR ] .
The authors further demonstrated that siRNA- and shRNA mediated silencing of STAT3 , as well as treatment with the small-molecule inhibitor STATTIC , which blocks STAT3 phosphorylation , significantly decreased clonogenic survival of CRC cell lines following exposure to 3 microM of 5-FU and irradiation in a dose dependent manner , with dose modifying factors ( DMF ) of 1.3 to 2.5 at a surviving fraction of 0.37 [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Using RNAi mediated inhibition of STAT3 expression , Yin and colleagues showed enhanced sensitization to radiotherapy in A549 and SK-MES-1 lung cancer cells [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Another serine/threonine protein kinase that phosphorylates STAT3 is CK2 .
Because STAT3 can also be phosphorylated by the IL-6 signaling cascade and because IL-6 is one of the most ubiquitously deregulated cytokines in cancer , it is a rational biological target for therapeutic investigations [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Restoration of TET3 antagonized TGF-beta1-triggered EMT as illustrated by reversion of E-cadherin downregulation and N-cadherin , Vimentin , and Snail upregulation . ++++ As fibrosis was also closely connected to EMT , we speculated that TET3 could be a suppressor of EMT functioning in different tissues and EMT associated events .
TET3 protein level was then detected , and consist with mRNA reduction , TET3 protein was decreased in TGF-beta1-stimulated ovarian cancer cells , indicating the potential involvement of TET3 in TGF-beta1 signaling .
To date , it was unclear how TGF-beta1 decreased TET3 .
Since TGF-beta1 could induce EMT in ovarian cancer cells in our previous study [ XREF_BIBR ] , we speculated that TET3 might participate in TGF-beta1-triggered EMT .
Silencing of TET3 inhibited apoptosis , promoted proliferation and induced cell fibrosis in LX-2 cells by downregulating long non coding RNA ( lncRNA ) HIF1A-AS1 [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Our results indicated that TET3 declined in TGF-beta1 stimulation and TET3 overexpression inhibited TGF-beta1-induced EMT and EMT mediated metastasis of SKOV3 and 3AO cells by demethylating miR-30d precursor gene , indicating a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation in ovarian cancer . ++++ Our results indicated that TET3 declined in TGF-beta1 stimulation and TET3 overexpression inhibited TGF-beta1-induced EMT and EMT mediated metastasis of SKOV3 and 3AO cells by demethylating miR-30d precursor gene , indicating a novel mechanism of epigenetic regulation in ovarian cancer .
Of note , TET3 overexpression alone could increase expression level of miR-30d and decrease methylation level of miR-30d precursor gene ( Additional file 2 : Figure S2A and S2B ) .

TET3 inhibits TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition by demethylating miR-30d precursor gene in ovarian cancer cells .
These data demonstrated that TGF-beta1-decreased TET3 contributed to higher methylation level of miR-30d precursor gene , subsequently caused miR-30d downregulation in ovarian cancer cells .
However , two other studies have suggested that OPTN negatively regulates TBK1 activation after RNA virus infection [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ OPTN insufficiency impairs TBK1 activation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation in primary cells . ++++ Indeed , OPTN deficiency in various cell lines and primary cells impairs TBK1 targeting to the Golgi apparatus and its activation following RLR or TLR3 stimulation .
The Vaccinia virus protein C6 binds TBK1 adaptor proteins ( TANK , NAP1 , and SINTBAD ) , thereby inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 [ XREF_BIBR ] , and the Gn protein of hantaviruses disrupts the formation of TBK1 complexes , thereby blocking downstream responses [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Potent RLR activation triggers TBK1 targeting and aggregation at the Golgi apparatus .
The Vaccinia virus protein C6 binds TBK1 adaptor proteins ( TANK , NAP1 , and SINTBAD ) , thereby inhibiting the activation of IRF3 and IRF7 [ XREF_BIBR ] , and the Gn protein of hantaviruses disrupts the formation of TBK1 complexes , thereby blocking downstream responses [ XREF_BIBR ] .

Importantly , TBK1 aggregation at the Golgi apparatus after poly ( I : C ) transfection was prevented by the silencing of OPTN . ++++ Finally , the comparison of WT and OPTN 470T bone marrow derived macrophages ( BMDM ) stimulated with poly ( I : C ) also confirmed that OPTN positively regulates TBK1 activation and downstream signaling after TLR3 stimulation without influencing NF-kappaB or ERK signaling .
Finally , further evidence for the involvement of OPTN in TBK1 activation is provided by our finding that the NS3 protein of the Bluetongue virus targets OPTN at the Golgi apparatus , decreasing TBK1 activation and the resulting IRF3 signaling . ++++ The NS3 protein of the Bluetongue virus targets OPTN to dampen IRF3 signaling .
The IKK complex activates NF-kappaB , promoting the production of pro inflammatory cytokines , and NF-kappaB activation requires the degradation of cytoplasmic inhibitors .
While the activated TBK1 induces type I interferon production by phosphorylating the transcription factor IRF3 , the precise molecular mechanisms underlying TBK1 activation remain unclear .
Together , our results suggest that OPTN recruits , at the Golgi apparatus , ubiquitinated TBK1 downstream from both RLRs and TLR3 in order to promote TBK1 activation and a signaling pathway resulting in the production of type I IFNs .
Non structural protein 3 ( NS3 ) of the Bluetongue virus , a dsRNA virus , has been localized to the Golgi apparatus and shown to specifically modulate the type I IFN signaling pathway [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Additionally , another study reported that BMDM from OPTN -/- mice displayed impaired IRF signaling and low levels of type I IFN production in response to poly ( I : C ) [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Consequently , smaller amounts of IFNbeta were produced and secreted , but no effect was observed on the NF-kappaB target IL-6 .
Consequently , smaller amounts of IFNbeta were produced and secreted , but no effect was observed on the NF-kappaB target IL-6 .
The NS3 protein of the Bluetongue virus targets OPTN to dampen IRF3 signaling .
We confirmed that NS3 expression led to the detection of this protein at the Golgi apparatus and that , in luciferase assays , NS3 affected the stimulation of the IFNbeta promoter but not NF-kappaB activation after RLR stimulation .
OPTN senses the K63 linked polyubiquitin chains on TBK1 , triggering the formation of TBK1-OPTN complexes , in which TBK1 is activated by trans-autophosphorylation .
Two independent studies have reported that RNA polymerase III detects DNA of viral or bacterial origin in the cytoplasm and induces type I IFNs via the RLR pathway [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Genetic and pharmacological inhibition studies have indicated that TBK1 can be activated by IKKbeta but that activation by trans-autophosphorylation is more likely [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Accordingly , NS3 expression decreased the phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 .
Accordingly , NS3 expression decreased the phosphorylation of both TBK1 and IRF3 .
TBK1 then phosphorylates IRF3 to promote type I IFN production to establish an antiviral response .
One key finding of this study is that ubiquitinated TBK1 is sensed by OPTN at the Golgi apparatus , promoting its trans-autophosphorylation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation .
Indeed , phosphorylation of the Ser177 residue of OPTN by TBK1 increases the association of OPTN with LC3 during xenophagy for the clearance of cytosolic Salmonella and the restriction of intracellular bacterial proliferation [ XREF_BIBR ] .
One key finding of this study is that ubiquitinated TBK1 is sensed by OPTN at the Golgi apparatus , promoting its trans-autophosphorylation after RLR or TLR3 stimulation .
The ubiquitin binding protein optineurin ( OPTN ) recruits ubiquitinated TBK1 to the Golgi apparatus , leading to the formation of complexes in which TBK1 is activated by trans-autophosphorylation .
It therefore seems possible that stimulation of the RLR pathway after bacterial infection promotes TBK1 activation by OPTN at the Golgi apparatus and that , on the one hand , p-TBK1 S172 triggers the production of type I IFNs and , on the other , the active kinase phosphorylates OPTN to induce the xenophagy of the invading bacteria .
This suggests that OPTN senses ubiquitinated TBK1 at the Golgi apparatus and promotes its activation , because the ubiquitination of TBK1 is required for its targeting to this organelle .
Once secreted , type I IFNs stimulate the transcription of IFN stimulated genes to prevent the virus from spreading and to activate the adaptive immune response [ XREF_BIBR ] .
XREF_BIBR showed that fibroblast growth factor blocked sonic hedgehog signaling in neural precursor cells . ++++ This ability of FGF to inhibit the hedgehog pathway was apparently mediated by both JNK and ERK , with JNK predominating .
Mutation or deletion of this docking site drastically reduces the ability of JNK2 to phosphorylate these residues XREF_BIBR .
For example , an FXFP-class docking site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate Ser383 , whereas the D-site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate other residues XREF_BIBR . ++++ For example , an FXFP-class docking site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate Ser383 , whereas the D-site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate other residues XREF_BIBR .
Thus , the D-site in Gli1 must primarily direct ERK2 to target residue ( s ) other than Ser130 .
XREF_BIBR found that Gli1 transcriptional activity was enhanced by activation of ERK , and that the first 130 residues of the 1100 +-residue Gli1 protein were required for sensing the ERK pathway .
For example , an FXFP-class docking site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate Ser383 , whereas the D-site in Elk-1 directs ERK to phosphorylate other residues XREF_BIBR .
For example , Kessaris et al. found that hedgehog stimulated differentiation of oligodendrocite progenitors required ERK activation XREF_BIBR .
Members of the training set included D-sites from the JNK activating kinases MKK4 and MKK7 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , JNK scaffold proteins such as JIP1-3 , JIP4 and SPAG9 , JSAP1 , and beta-arrestin2 XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , and JNK substrates such as the transcription factors c-Jun , ATF2 , Elk-1 and Net XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
Indeed , Hanahan and colleagues have recently proposed that in pancreatic cancer , non canonical RAS mediated activation of Gli proteins is the primary mechanism of tumorigenesis XREF_BIBR .
Thus the D-site promotes MAPK mediated phosphorylation of Gli3 . ++++ Thus the D-site promotes MAPK mediated phosphorylation of Gli3 . ++++ We hypothesized that the newly identified D-site might promote the MAPK mediated phosphorylation of Gli3 .
We did not examine whether the D-site promoted ERK mediated phosphorylation of Ser284 or JNK mediated phosphorylation of Ser216 . ++++ We did not examine whether the D-site promoted ERK mediated phosphorylation of Ser284 or JNK mediated phosphorylation of Ser216 .
As an alternative means to assess D-site-mediated phosphorylation of PPM1J by JNK , V5-epitope-tagged versions of the wild-type and D-site point mutant of PPM1J were expressed in Cos-1 cells and immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody . ++++ To determine if the novel D-site promoted the phosphorylation of PPM1J by JNK , the GST fused wild-type PPM1J protein and a GST fused D-site point mutant derivative ( DSM ) were incubated with active JNK1 , JNK2 , and JNK3 and radioactive ATP in a standard kinase assay ( XREF_FIG ) .
Moreover , JNK phosphorylation of Ser 92 of PPM1J reduces its phosphatase activity XREF_BIBR .
For example , when the MAP kinase JNK2 phosphorylates its transcription factor target c-Jun , it first tethers itself to a docking site located within residues 30-45 of c-Jun , and then phosphorylates c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 .
Similar to the results seen with ERK2 phosphorylation of Gli3 S243A , there was considerable ERK mediated phosphorylation of GST-Gli1 68-232 even when Ser130 was mutated to alanine .
As detailed in the previous section , our mass spectrometry and mutagenesis analysis revealed that Ser343 of Gli3 was phosphorylated by JNKs .
MKK4 and MKK7 are the physiological ( cognate ) activators of JNK1-3 , whereas the MAPK kinases MEK1/2 and MKK3/6 activate the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases , respectively , and do not phosphorylate JNK1-3 .
In addition , active ERK2 phosphorylated the GST-hnRNP-K fragment , and the extent of phosphorylation was slightly reduced by removal of the D-site ( data not shown ) .
Similar to the results seen with ERK2 phosphorylation of Gli3 S243A , there was considerable ERK mediated phosphorylation of GST-Gli1 68-232 even when Ser130 was mutated to alanine .
Protein kinases phosphorylate serine/threonine or tyrosine residues in proteins , and a few residues on either side of the target phosphoacceptor residue typically also influence kinase-target selection XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR .
GST alone was not phosphorylated by any of the active MAPK enzymes used in this work ( data not shown ) .
MKK4 and MKK7 are the physiological ( cognate ) activators of JNK1-3 , whereas the MAPK kinases MEK1/2 and MKK3/6 activate the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases , respectively , and do not phosphorylate JNK1-3 .
This result indicates that Ser130 is the major target phosphosite for D-site-directed JNK phosphorylation of Gli1 68-232 .
JNK phosphorylation of Ser130 in Gli1 is mediated by the predicted and experimentally verified D-site ; however , this same D-site directs ERK2 to phosphorylate a distinct target site ( s ) in Gli1 .
For example , when the MAP kinase JNK2 phosphorylates its transcription factor target c-Jun , it first tethers itself to a docking site located within residues 30-45 of c-Jun , and then phosphorylates c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 .
For example , when the MAP kinase JNK2 phosphorylates its transcription factor target c-Jun , it first tethers itself to a docking site located within residues 30-45 of c-Jun , and then phosphorylates c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 .
Having established that this D-site mediated JNK binding to hnRNP-K , we next wanted to determine if it also facilitated the phosphorylation of hnRNP-K by JNK at the known JNK target phosphosite Ser353 .
For example , when the MAP kinase JNK2 phosphorylates its transcription factor target c-Jun , it first tethers itself to a docking site located within residues 30-45 of c-Jun , and then phosphorylates c-Jun on Ser63 and Ser73 .

The result of this assay ( XREF_FIG ) showed a reduction in phosphorylation of the GST-Gli3 280-478 S343A protein to the low levels seen with the D-site mutant protein , confirming the mass spectrometry results .

ST6GalNac-1 prevents O-glycan elongation by adding a sialic acid residue in alpha2,6-linkage to GalNAc-O-Ser and Thr , a carbohydrate structure known as sialyl-Tn antigen [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
When tested in vivo in a tumor metastasis model of B16 melanoma , mice injected with CIN85 depleted melanoma cells exhibited few or no lung metastasis and , similarly to the in vitro results , overexpression of MUC1 recovered the shCIN85 reduced metastatic process .
siRNA mediated silencing of CIN85 and/or MUC1 revealed that MUC1 enhances CIN85 dependent breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro . ++++ In agreement with our in vitro data , our results showed that CIN85 activity is suppressed by MUC1 overexpression , indicating that CIN85 activity is modulated by MUC1 .

siRNA mediated silencing of CIN85 and/or MUC1 revealed that MUC1 enhances CIN85 dependent breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro .
On the other hand , ectopic expression of MUC1 partially overcame this inhibition of migration and invasion induced by siCIN85 .
MUC1 has been reported to enhance liver and lung metastasis in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer [ XREF_BIBR ] and high MUC1 expression has been correlated with metastatic tumor phenotype in human cancer [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Transfection of C1GalT1 shRNA into MDA-MB-231 MUC1+ breast tumor cells decreased C1GalT1 protein level by 90 % compared with untransfected cells ( Fig XREF_FIG ) .

When anti-MUC1 immunoprecipitates from MDA-MB-231+ shC1GalT1 lysates with were immunoblotted with anti-CIN85 , we observed that down-regulation of C1GalT1 enhanced the amount of co-precipitated CIN85 ( Fig XREF_FIG ) .
Using genetic approaches , we demonstrated that depletion of CSF-1 in this model markedly decreased the infiltration of macrophages at the tumor site and this correlated with a significant delay of tumour progression to metastasis . ++++ Using genetic approaches , we demonstrated that depletion of CSF-1 in this model markedly decreased the infiltration of macrophages at the tumor site and this correlated with a significant delay of tumour progression to metastasis .
Furthermore , neutrophil recruiting cytokines such as GRO ( IL-8 homologues ) may also directly stimulate tumour proliferation in melanoma ( Haghnegahdar et al , 2000 ) .
In addition , they can produce specific angiogenic mediators including histamine and heparin , which can stimulate endothelial cell proliferation and may contribute to the hyperpermeable nature of newly formed microvessels during pathological angiogenesis ( Ribatti et al , 2001 ) , and a variety of proteases , particularly MMP9 , which are involved in angiogenesis .

We envisioned that UCN-01 would both inhibit Chk1 to abrogate checkpoint responses induced by irinotecan and inhibit PDK1 to induce apoptosis .
However , the decrease in pS6 was significant in PBMC , indicating that UCN-01 is bioavailable and inhibits PDK1 at the MTD for at least 24h after the first dose of UCN-01 .
Therefore , this treatment regimen may not be optimal for inducing checkpoint bypass in response to the DNA damage induced by irinotecan .
With S- and G2-checkpoint abrogation by Chk1 inhibition , p53 deficient cancer cells fail to arrest and undergo mitotic catastrophe and eventually apoptosis [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] .
Two partial responses ( 8 % ) lasting 13 and 18weeks were observed in women with triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC , estrogen and progesterone receptor negative and HER-2 negative ) with chest wall and lymph node recurrences previously treated with an anthracycline , taxane , and capecitabine .
Since a key downstream target of PDK1 is p70S6K , which phosphorylates S6 [ XREF_BIBR , XREF_BIBR ] , we hypothesized that if UCN-01 inhibited PDK1 , we would observe reduced pS6 .
Contrary to some proposals , Arp2/3 complex mediated branching of actin alone is insufficient for establishing an orthogonal actin organization or maintaining mechanical stability at the leading edge .
Conversely , FLNa produces orthogonal actin networks in vitro without the intermediacy of Arp2/3 complexes ( XREF_BIBR ; XREF_BIBR ) .
The data shown in Figure XREF_FIG indicate that down regulation of hnRNP A18 significantly reduces melanoma cells ' invasion and migration properties while over expression of hnRNP A18 significantly increases these parameters . ++++ Moreover , hnRNP A18 is over expressed in 40 to 60 % of human melanoma , prostate , breast and colon cancer tissue as compared to normal adjacent tissue and down regulation of hnRNP A18 decreases proliferation , invasion and migration in addition to significantly reducing tumor growth in two mouse xenograft models . ++++ The data shown in Figure XREF_FIG indicate that down regulation of hnRNP A18 significantly reduced breast cancer cells ' proliferation , invasion and migration . ++++ Most importantly , down regulation of hnRNP A18 decreases proliferation , invasion and migration in addition to significantly reducing tumor growth in two mouse xenograft models , melanoma and breast cancer .

In the presence of CoCl 2 , HIF-1alpha half-life increases to 3.26 h and down regulation of hnRNP A18 reduces it to 1.43 h for a difference of 1.83 h. Therefore , our data indicate that the binding of hnRNP A18 HIF-1alpha mRNA in the presence of CoCl 2 significantly increases HIF-1alpha mRNA half-life by almost 2h .
In fact , levels of HIF-1alpha correlate with melanoma growth [ XREF_BIBR ] , and inhibition of ATR has been shown to increase apoptosis in UV exposed primary human keratinocytes [ XREF_BIBR ] .
Data from tissue extracted from four tumors grown in vivo from cells expressing reduced or endogenous ( sc , lanes 1 , 2 ) hnRNP A18 levels indicate that down regulation of hnRNP A18 prevents upregulation of HIF-1alpha in the tumors .
Our data ( XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY ) indicate that indeed down regulation of HIF-1alpha significantly reduces cell viability in the presence of CoCl 2 .
In the cytosol , hnRNP A18 binds to a specific 51 nucleotide RNA signature motif present in the 3 ' UTR of targeted transcripts and increases their translation by interacting with eukaryotic initiation factor 4G ( eIF4G ) , a component of the general translation cap binding complex eIF4F , on polysomes [ XREF_BIBR ] [ XREF_BIBR ] [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ These data thus support the notion that hnRNP A18 increases mRNA stability and translation of its targeted transcripts under cellular stress conditions . ++++ hnRNP A18 thus appears to promote tumor growth by coordinating the translation of functionally related transcripts associated with proliferation , survival and invasion . ++++ The data generated so far indicate that hnRNP A18 stabilizes its targeted transcripts and increases their translation , but as it is the case for other stress responsive RNA binding proteins such as HuR it remains possible that some potential anti-proliferative targets could be destabilized and down regulated for an overall growth advantage effect [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ In the cytosol , hnRNP A18 binds to its targeted transcripts , stabilizes the transcripts and increase their translation . ++++ These data thus indicate that hnRNP A18 can promote tumor growth in in vivo models by coordinating the translation of pro survival transcripts to support the demands of proliferating cells and increase survival under cellular stress .
Nonetheless , hypoxic conditions could provide an amplification environment whereby hnRNP A18 could up-regulate HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha could in turn contribute to sustaining hnRNP A18 levels during prolonged hypoxia . ++++ Nonetheless , hypoxic conditions could provide an amplification environment whereby hnRNP A18 could up-regulate HIF-1alpha and HIF-1alpha could in turn contribute to sustaining hnRNP A18 levels during prolonged hypoxia . ++++ However , it remains to be determined whether these factors could also be directly regulated by hnRNP A18 .
However , hnRNP A18 up-regulation in response to hypoxia is independent of HIF-1alpha [ XREF_BIBR ] . ++++ As with other stress responsive proteins we expect that oncogenic pathways characteristic of cancer cells will contribute to hnRNP A18 upregulation in response to hypoxia . ++++ The mechanisms that may lead to hnRNP A18 upregulation in response to hypoxia in normal cells are thus likely to be different than in cancer cells .
One possible mechanism by which hnRNP A18 could contribute to cellular migration and proliferation is through regulation of TRX and HIF-1alpha which both have been associated with these tumor promoting events . ++++ hnRNP A18 promotes proliferation , invasion and migration .
When phosphorylated , eIF4E-BP1 relieves the translational repression imposed on eIF4E and allows translation to proceed .
Actually , a recent study indicated that hnRNP A18 and CIRP contributed to intestinal inflammation and colitis associated cancer [ XREF_BIBR ] .
GSK-3beta also increases hnRNP A18 RNA binding activity and both , hnRNP A18 RNA binding domain and the RGG domain are required for maximal hnRNP A18 RNA binding activity [ XREF_BIBR ] .

hnRNP A18 promotes proliferation , invasion and migration .
hnRNP A18 could also promote tumor growth by regulating the expression of key regulators of the cellular oxidation-reduction homeostasis .
Western blot analyses indicate that down regulation of hnRNP A18 reduced the basal protein levels of TRX in melanoma cells .
The data shown in Figure XREF_FIG indicate that HIF-1alpha is over expressed in response to CoCl 2 ( lanes 2 and 4 ) but down regulation of hnRNP A18 significantly reduces HIF-1alpha protein levels in response to CoCl 2 ( lane 6 and Figure XREF_FIG ) .
In addition , hnRNP A18 can modify the ratio of eIF4E-BP1 and phosphorylated eIF4E-BP1 to facilitate translation .
